# Task: Run Architecture Fitness Functions

## Purpose
Define and run automated architecture fitness functions for continuous architectural governance.

## Steps

### 1. Assess Current State
```
Current situation: [describe current state]
Gap identified: [what needs to change]
Impact: [business/technical impact]
```

### 2. Design Solution
```
Approach: [chosen approach with rationale]
Alternatives considered: [what else was evaluated]
Trade-offs: [what are we accepting]
Dependencies: [what needs to be in place first]
```

### 3. Implement
```
Implementation steps:
  1. [step 1 — specific action]
  2. [step 2 — specific action]
  3. [step 3 — specific action]
  4. [step 4 — specific action]
Risk mitigation: [how to reduce risk]
```

### 4. Verify
```
Verification criteria:
  - [criterion 1 — measurable]
  - [criterion 2 — measurable]
  - [criterion 3 — measurable]
Rollback plan: [how to revert if issues arise]
```

## Deliverables
- [ ] Assessment document
- [ ] Design document / ADR
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Verification passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Quality Gate
- Solution reviewed by eng-architect
- All verification criteria met
- No regressions introduced


## Practical Examples

### Example: ADR
```markdown
# ADR-003: Use Event-Driven Architecture for Order Processing

## Status: Accepted

## Context
Order processing involves 5 downstream services (billing, shipping,
inventory, analytics, notification). Current synchronous approach:
- Request latency: 2.5 seconds (sum of all downstream calls)
- Coupling: order-api must know about all 5 services
- Availability: if any downstream fails, order fails

## Decision
Use event-driven architecture with domain events:
- order-api publishes OrderPlaced event
- Each downstream service subscribes independently
- Kafka as event broker (durable, ordered, replayable)

## Consequences
Positive:
  - Latency: 50ms (just publish event)
  - Coupling: order-api knows nothing about consumers
  - Availability: downstream failures don't affect orders
Negative:
  - Eventual consistency (billing may lag 2-5 seconds)
  - Debugging: distributed tracing needed
  - Complexity: event schema evolution, idempotency
```

## Common Pitfalls
1. **No ADR for significant decisions** — decisions get lost or forgotten
2. **Optimizing for all -ilities** — you can't, pick top 3-5
3. **Big-bang architecture changes** — use evolutionary approach
4. **No fitness functions** — architecture erodes without enforcement
5. **Ivory tower architecture** — architects should code too


## War Room Protocol

### When This Task Is Triggered By An Incident

```
MINUTE 0-5: ASSESS
  □ Confirm the issue is real (not false positive)
  □ Check: Is it customer-facing?
  □ Check: Is data at risk?
  □ Classify severity:
     SEV1: > 50% users affected → all-hands
     SEV2: < 50% users degraded → team + lead
     SEV3: internal only → on-call

MINUTE 5-15: CONTAIN
  □ Can we rollback the last deploy?
  □ Can we toggle a feature flag?
  □ Can we scale up resources?
  □ Can we redirect traffic?
  □ Communicate: team channel + status page

MINUTE 15-30: DIAGNOSE
  □ Check dashboards (4 Golden Signals)
  □ Check logs (grep for errors in last 30 min)
  □ Check recent changes (deploys, config, infra)
  □ Check dependencies (are they healthy?)
  □ Form hypothesis: "I think the problem is ___"

MINUTE 30-60: FIX
  □ If hypothesis confirmed → implement fix
  □ If not confirmed → gather more data, new hypothesis
  □ Deploy fix through normal pipeline (or hotfix if SEV1)
  □ Verify fix: check dashboards, check affected users

AFTER RESOLUTION:
  □ Update status page: "Resolved"
  □ Notify stakeholders
  □ Schedule post-mortem (within 48h)
  □ Create action items to prevent recurrence
```

### Handoff Protocol

```
WHEN HANDING THIS TASK TO ANOTHER ENGINEER:

Provide:
  1. Context: What is the task and why?
  2. Current state: What has been done so far?
  3. Next steps: What needs to happen next?
  4. Blockers: Any known issues or dependencies?
  5. Contacts: Who to ask for help?
  6. Artifacts: Links to relevant docs, PRs, dashboards

Format:
  ## Handoff — [Task Name]
  **From:** [your name]  **To:** [their name]  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
  
  **Context:** [1-2 sentences]
  **Done:** [bulleted list]
  **Next:** [bulleted list]
  **Blockers:** [if any]
  **Links:** [dashboards, PRs, docs]
```

### Quality Gate

```
THIS TASK IS COMPLETE WHEN:
  □ All acceptance criteria met
  □ Tests written and passing
  □ Code reviewed by peer
  □ Documentation updated
  □ Deployed to staging and verified
  □ Product owner accepted
  □ No P0 or P1 issues outstanding

THIS TASK MAY BE DEFERRED IF:
  ○ Blocked by external dependency (document and escalate)
  ○ Scope discovered to be larger than estimated (split task)
  ○ Higher priority item emerged (document reason for deferral)
```
