## Anti-Patterns Encyclopedia

### Architecture Anti-Patterns

#### Distributed Monolith
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ Microservices that MUST be deployed together
  ✓ Shared database between services
  ✓ Synchronous call chains: A → B → C → D
  ✓ Breaking change in one service breaks all others
  ✓ "We have microservices!" but deploy frequency: monthly
  
DIAGNOSIS TEST:
  "Can you deploy service A independently, right now?"
  If NO → you have a distributed monolith
  
ROOT CAUSES:
  1. Shared database (coupling through schema)
  2. Synchronous communication everywhere (REST call chains)
  3. Shared libraries with domain logic
  4. No bounded context design (services share concepts)
  
FIX (incremental):
  Phase 1: Identify coupling points (shared DB, shared libs)
  Phase 2: Introduce API boundaries (each service owns its data)
  Phase 3: Replace synchronous with async where possible (events)
  Phase 4: Enable independent deployment (contract tests)
  
REFERENCE: Sam Newman — "Building Microservices", Chapter 3
```

#### Big Ball of Mud
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ No identifiable architecture
  ✓ Any file can depend on any other file
  ✓ Functions > 500 lines
  ✓ Circular dependencies everywhere
  ✓ "Don't touch that code, it might break everything"
  ✓ Business logic mixed with UI and database code
  
DIAGNOSIS:
  Run dependency analysis tool:
    - Java: jdepend, ArchUnit
    - JavaScript: madge, depcheck
    - Python: pydeps
  
  If dependency graph looks like spaghetti → Big Ball of Mud
  
RECOVERY PATH (Strangler Fig):
  1. Draw boundary around the mess (don't try to fix inside)
  2. New features: build OUTSIDE the mess, call into it when needed
  3. Extract clean modules one by one (start with highest-value)
  4. Test characteristically before each extraction
  5. Over 6-12 months, the mess shrinks as clean code grows
  
REFERENCE: Brian Foote & Joseph Yoder — original paper (1999)
```

#### Premature Microservices
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ Team of 3-5 developers maintaining 15+ services
  ✓ More time on infrastructure than features
  ✓ "How does data get from A to B?" requires 30-min investigation
  ✓ Local development requires 8+ Docker containers
  ✓ No service has more than 500 lines of code
  
DIAGNOSIS TEST:
  "Do you have more services than developers?"
  If YES → probably premature microservices
  
ALTERNATIVE: Modular Monolith
  Single deployment unit
  Internal module boundaries (packages, namespaces)
  Module communication through interfaces (not direct)
  Each module can be extracted to service WHEN PROVEN NEED
  
  WHEN to extract module to service:
  □ Different scaling needs (module needs 10x more resources)
  □ Different deployment frequency (team ships 10x/day)
  □ Different technology requirements (ML model in Python)
  □ Team autonomy (separate team owns the domain)
  
  If NONE of the above → keep as monolith module
  
REFERENCE: Martin Fowler — "MonolithFirst" (2015)
```

### Code Anti-Patterns

#### God Class
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ Class > 500 lines
  ✓ Class name contains "Manager", "Handler", "Processor", "Utils"
  ✓ Methods that don't use most of the class's fields
  ✓ Other classes only use this class (it knows everything)
  ✓ Every new feature touches this class

EXAMPLE:
  class OrderManager:  # 2000 lines, does EVERYTHING
    def create_order()
    def validate_order()
    def calculate_shipping()
    def calculate_tax()
    def process_payment()
    def send_confirmation_email()
    def generate_invoice_pdf()
    def update_inventory()
    def create_analytics_event()
    def check_fraud()
    
FIX: Extract by responsibility
  class OrderCreator:       create_order(), validate_order()
  class ShippingCalculator:  calculate_shipping()
  class TaxCalculator:       calculate_tax()
  class PaymentProcessor:    process_payment(), check_fraud()
  class OrderNotifier:       send_confirmation_email()
  class InvoiceGenerator:    generate_invoice_pdf()
  class InventoryUpdater:    update_inventory()
  
REFERENCE: Martin Fowler — "Refactoring" (Extract Class)
```

#### Cargo Cult Programming
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ Team uses Kubernetes for 2 services with 10 users
  ✓ Event sourcing for a CRUD app
  ✓ Microservices because "Netflix does it"
  ✓ Adding design patterns without solving a problem
  ✓ "We need GraphQL" but have 1 frontend and 1 API
  
DIAGNOSIS TEST:
  "What problem does this technology solve for US?"
  If answer is "everyone uses it" → cargo cult
  
FIX: Problem-first technology choice
  1. Define the PROBLEM clearly
  2. List 2-3 technology options
  3. Evaluate trade-offs for YOUR context
  4. Choose the SIMPLEST option that solves the problem
  5. Document decision in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
  
DECISION FRAMEWORK:
  "Is this the simplest thing that could possibly work?"
  If NO → you might be over-engineering
  
REFERENCE: Ward Cunningham — YAGNI principle
```

### Process Anti-Patterns

#### Hero Culture
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ One person fixes all production incidents
  ✓ "Only Sarah knows how the billing system works"
  ✓ Heroes work nights/weekends regularly
  ✓ Team feels helpless when hero is on vacation
  ✓ Hero has 50+ unread code review requests
  
IMPACT:
  Bus factor = 1 (if hero leaves, system is at risk)
  Hero burns out → leaves → crisis
  Team never grows (hero solves everything)
  
FIX (systematic):
  1. Knowledge sharing: hero writes documentation
  2. Pair programming: hero pairs with others on critical code
  3. Rotation: others handle incidents (hero available for escalation)
  4. Limit WIP: hero reviews max 3 PRs/day (others must review too)
  5. Blameless culture: mistakes during learning are expected
  6. On-call rotation: mandatory for all engineers (not just hero)
  
METRIC: Bus factor should be ≥ 2 for every system
  "Can at least 2 people modify and deploy this system?"
  
REFERENCE: Accelerate (Forsgren et al.) — "High-performing teams
have NO single points of failure in knowledge"
```

#### Deploy and Pray
```
SYMPTOMS:
  ✓ No rollback plan
  ✓ Deploy on Friday at 17:00
  ✓ No monitoring or alerting configured
  ✓ "Looks good on my machine, ship it!"
  ✓ Manual deployment steps (SSH, FTP, copy files)
  ✓ No staging environment
  
FIX: Progressive Delivery
  1. Automated CI/CD (zero manual steps)
  2. Deploy to staging first (production-like environment)
  3. Smoke tests after deploy (automated health checks)
  4. Canary deployment: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
  5. Automated rollback on error rate spike
  6. Feature flags for high-risk changes
  7. Deploy ONLY Mon-Thu before 15:00 (time to fix issues)
  
REFERENCE: Accelerate — "Deployment frequency is a key
metric of high-performing teams"
```


## Code Evolution Histories (Bad → Better → Best)

### Evolution 1: Error Handling

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Swallowing Errors)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error!")
        return False
```
*Why it's bad*: Swallows all context. Was it a network error? Insufficient funds? DB timeout? The caller has no idea, and the logs are useless.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Logging and Reraising)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except StripeError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Payment failed for user {user_id}: {e.message}")
        raise PaymentDeclinedException(e.message)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"System error during payment for user {user_id}", exc_info=True)
        raise SystemFailureException("Please try again later")
```
*Why it's better*: Specific exceptions caught. Logs include context and stack traces for unexpected errors. Caller gets meaningful domain exceptions.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Result Monad or Domain Errors + Outbox)**
```python
# Using a Result pattern (common in Rust/Go, implemented in Python/TS via libraries)
def process_payment(user_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> Result[PaymentReceipt, PaymentError]:
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        return Err(UserNotFoundError(user_id))
        
    charge_result = gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
    if charge_result.is_err():
        return Err(ProviderDeclinedError(charge_result.error))
        
    # Transactional Outbox pattern for DB consistency + Event publishing
    with db.transaction() as tx:
        receipt = tx.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        tx.insert_outbox_event("PaymentCompleted", receipt.to_json())
        
    return Ok(receipt)
```
*Why it's best*: No exceptions used for control flow. The type signature explicitly declares that this function can fail and dictates exactly how. ACID consistency guaranteed via outbox for side effects.

### Evolution 2: Configuration Injection

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Hardcoded / Global state)**
```python
# settings.py
DB_HOST = "localhost"
STRIPE_KEY = "sk_test_123"

# service.py
import settings
def get_user(id):
    conn = connect(settings.DB_HOST)
    # ...
```
*Why it's bad*: Impossible to test properly. Changing config means editing code. Secrets might get committed.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Environment Variables directly)**
```python
# service.py
import os
def get_user(id):
    host = os.environ.get("DB_HOST", "localhost")
    conn = connect(host)
    # ...
```
*Why it's better*: Follows 12-Factor app methodology. Code is separate from config.
*Why it's still flawed*: Scattered reads of `os.environ`. Hard to know all required env vars. Type casting is manual and error-prone. Difficult to mock in tests without messing with global `os.environ`.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Strongly Typed Config Maps injected via DI)**
```python
# config.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, SecretStr

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    db_conn_string: str
    stripe_api_key: SecretStr
    timeout_ms: int = 5000
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

# service.py
class UserService:
    # Dependency Injection
    def __init__(self, db_pool: ConnectionPool, config: AppConfig):
        self.db = db_pool
        self.config = config
        
    def get_user(self, id):
        query_timeout = self.config.timeout_ms
        # ...
```
*Why it's best*: Fail-fast on startup if env vars are missing or wrong type. Secrets are protected from accidental logging (`SecretStr`). Service is completely decoupled from *how* config is loaded, making unit testing trivial (just pass a mock `AppConfig` instance).


## Architecture Katas: Practice Scenarios

### Kata 1: The Concert Ticket Sales System
**Context**: You are building a system to sell tickets for highly anticipated concerts (e.g., Taylor Swift, BTS).
**Requirements**: 
- 5 million users attempting to buy 100,000 tickets at the exact same second the sale opens.
- Users must not be able to double-book a seat.
- Users have 10 minutes to complete payment once a seat is reserved.
- Payment processing takes up to 30 seconds.
**Constraints**: 
- Cloud-native architecture.
- 99.99% availability during the sale hour.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Handling the Thundering Herd**: How do you prevent your API and Database from melting at T-0?
   *Expected approach*: Edge caching for static content (CDN). Virtual waiting room (queue) implemented at the load balancer or via edge workers (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) to drip-feed traffic to the backend, protecting the database.
2. **Concurrency Control for Seats**: 
   *Expected approach*: Use Redis with Lua scripts or Redlock for atomic "reserve seat" operations. Relational DB (PostgreSQL) with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for assigning available seats from a pool without blocking the whole table.
3. **The 10-Minute Hold**: 
   *Expected approach*: Expiring keys in Redis (Keyspace notifications) or a delayed message queue (SQS delay seconds, RabbitMQ dead-letter exchange) to release the seat if payment isn't confirmed in 10 minutes.

### Kata 2: Global Ride-Sharing Backend (Uber clone)
**Context**: A ride-sharing app operating in 500 cities globally.
**Requirements**:
- Drivers send location updates every 3 seconds.
- Riders request rides and are matched with the nearest driver within 5 seconds.
- 1 million active drivers globally.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Location Ingestion at Scale**: 
   *Expected approach*: 1M drivers / 3sec = ~333,000 requests per second. REST is too heavy. Use WebSockets, gRPC stream, or UDP. Ingest into a distributed commit log (Kafka) to decouple ingestion from processing.
2. **Geospatial Indexing**: 
   *Expected approach*: QuadTrees, Geohashes, or H3/S2 libraries. Store active driver locations in an in-memory datastore with geospatial capabilities (Redis GEO, or a custom service holding Geohash buckets in RAM) since data is highly volatile. PostgreSQL+PostGIS is great for permanent records but too slow for 333k RPS updates.
3. **Matching Algorithm (Real-time)**: 
   *Expected approach*: Stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming) or dedicated matching worker nodes subscribed to specific Geohash partitions to calculate ETA and match.

### Kata 3: Bank Account Ledger
**Context**: A core banking system handling transfers between accounts.
**Requirements**:
- Zero lost money. Absolute consistency.
- High auditability (every change must be recorded and traceable).
- 10,000 transactions per second during peak.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Data Modeling**: 
   *Expected approach*: Event Sourcing. Accounts don't have a mutable "balance" column. The balance is a derived projection computed by summing all immutable ledger entries (credits and debits) for that account.
2. **Double-Entry Accounting**: 
   *Expected approach*: Every transaction must have at least two legs (debit Account A, credit Account B) that sum to zero. Inserted in a single ACID serializable transaction.
3. **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**: 
   *Expected approach*: Optimistic Concurrency Control (Version tracking) to allow high throughput, falling back to Pessimistic only when contention on a single "hot" account is detected.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.

## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.
