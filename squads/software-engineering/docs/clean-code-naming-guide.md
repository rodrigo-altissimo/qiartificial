## Core Principles

### 1. Names Reveal Intent
A name should tell you WHY it exists, WHAT it does, and HOW it is used.

```
BAD:  int d;  // elapsed time in days
GOOD: int elapsedDays;

BAD:  getUserInfo()   — what info? all of it? name only?
GOOD: getUserEmail()  — clear, specific, predictable

BAD:  DataManager, InfoHandler, ProcessHelper
GOOD: OrderRepository, EmailSender, TaxCalculator
```

### 2. Functions Do One Thing
A function should do one thing, do it well, and do it only.

```
RULES:
  1. Can you describe the function WITHOUT using "and"/"or"? → one thing
  2. Maximum 3 parameters (1-2 ideal, 0 best)
  3. Target: < 20 lines (< 10 ideal)
  4. No side effects hidden by the function name
  5. Command or query, not both (CQS)

BAD:  validateAndSave(user)  — does two things
GOOD: validate(user) then save(user)  — each does one thing
```

### 3. Deep Modules (Ousterhout)
A deep module has a simple interface but hides significant complexity.

```
DEEP MODULE (good):
  ┌──────────┐
  │ simple   │  ← narrow interface (few methods, few params)
  │ interface│
  ├──────────┤
  │          │
  │  complex │  ← hides lots of complexity
  │  impl    │
  │          │
  └──────────┘

SHALLOW MODULE (bad):
  ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ complex interface    │  ← wide interface
  ├──────────────────────┤
  │ simple impl          │  ← trivial implementation
  └──────────────────────┘
  
  Shallow modules add complexity without hiding it.
```


## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Step 1: Preparation
```
1. Review current state and identify gaps
2. Gather requirements from stakeholders
3. Define success criteria (measurable)
4. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
```

### Step 2: Execution
```
1. Follow the patterns and principles above
2. Document decisions as ADRs
3. Implement with tests
4. Review with relevant specialist agent
```

### Step 3: Validation
```
1. Run relevant checklist
2. Verify against success criteria
3. Get sign-off from eng-audit
4. Document learnings
```

### 2. Refactoring Recipes (Step-by-Step)

```python
# ============================================================
# RECIPE 1: Extract Method
# ============================================================

# BEFORE: Method doing multiple things
def process_order(order):
    # validate — responsibility 1
    if not order.customer_id:
        raise ValueError("Missing customer")
    if not order.items:

    return Totals(subtotal=subtotal, tax=tax, shipping=shipping)

# ============================================================
# RECIPE 2: Replace Conditional with Strategy
# ============================================================

# BEFORE: Growing switch/if chain
def calculate_discount(customer_type, order_total):
    if customer_type == "regular":
        return order_total * Decimal("0.00")
    elif customer_type == "premium":

## Architecture Katas: Practice Scenarios

### Kata 1: The Concert Ticket Sales System
**Context**: You are building a system to sell tickets for highly anticipated concerts (e.g., Taylor Swift, BTS).
**Requirements**: 
- 5 million users attempting to buy 100,000 tickets at the exact same second the sale opens.
- Users must not be able to double-book a seat.
- Users have 10 minutes to complete payment once a seat is reserved.
- Payment processing takes up to 30 seconds.
**Constraints**: 
- Cloud-native architecture.
- 99.99% availability during the sale hour.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Handling the Thundering Herd**: How do you prevent your API and Database from melting at T-0?
   *Expected approach*: Edge caching for static content (CDN). Virtual waiting room (queue) implemented at the load balancer or via edge workers (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) to drip-feed traffic to the backend, protecting the database.
2. **Concurrency Control for Seats**: 
   *Expected approach*: Use Redis with Lua scripts or Redlock for atomic "reserve seat" operations. Relational DB (PostgreSQL) with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for assigning available seats from a pool without blocking the whole table.
3. **The 10-Minute Hold**: 
   *Expected approach*: Expiring keys in Redis (Keyspace notifications) or a delayed message queue (SQS delay seconds, RabbitMQ dead-letter exchange) to release the seat if payment isn't confirmed in 10 minutes.

### Kata 2: Global Ride-Sharing Backend (Uber clone)
**Context**: A ride-sharing app operating in 500 cities globally.
**Requirements**:
- Drivers send location updates every 3 seconds.
- Riders request rides and are matched with the nearest driver within 5 seconds.
- 1 million active drivers globally.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Location Ingestion at Scale**: 
   *Expected approach*: 1M drivers / 3sec = ~333,000 requests per second. REST is too heavy. Use WebSockets, gRPC stream, or UDP. Ingest into a distributed commit log (Kafka) to decouple ingestion from processing.
2. **Geospatial Indexing**: 
   *Expected approach*: QuadTrees, Geohashes, or H3/S2 libraries. Store active driver locations in an in-memory datastore with geospatial capabilities (Redis GEO, or a custom service holding Geohash buckets in RAM) since data is highly volatile. PostgreSQL+PostGIS is great for permanent records but too slow for 333k RPS updates.
3. **Matching Algorithm (Real-time)**: 
   *Expected approach*: Stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming) or dedicated matching worker nodes subscribed to specific Geohash partitions to calculate ETA and match.

### Kata 3: Bank Account Ledger
**Context**: A core banking system handling transfers between accounts.
**Requirements**:
- Zero lost money. Absolute consistency.
- High auditability (every change must be recorded and traceable).
- 10,000 transactions per second during peak.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Data Modeling**: 
   *Expected approach*: Event Sourcing. Accounts don't have a mutable "balance" column. The balance is a derived projection computed by summing all immutable ledger entries (credits and debits) for that account.
2. **Double-Entry Accounting**: 
   *Expected approach*: Every transaction must have at least two legs (debit Account A, credit Account B) that sum to zero. Inserted in a single ACID serializable transaction.
3. **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**: 
   *Expected approach*: Optimistic Concurrency Control (Version tracking) to allow high throughput, falling back to Pessimistic only when contention on a single "hot" account is detected.


## Migration Playbooks: Zero-Downtime Operations

### Database Engine Migration (e.g., MySQL to PostgreSQL)
**Goal**: Move 5TB of data to a new database engine with zero seconds of planned downtime.

**Phase 1: Dual Write (Application level)**
1. Modify application repository layer to write to BOTH old (primary) and new (secondary) databases.
2. Old database remains the source of truth for all reads.
3. Wrap dual writes in feature flags or circuit breakers so failures in the new DB don't impact users.
4. *Risk*: Data modification happening exactly during the cutover of historical data. Handle via "last updated at" timestamps.

**Phase 2: Historical Data Backfill**
1. Write a script to dump and load data from Old to New DB.
2. Process in chunks (e.g., 100,000 rows at a time) to avoid memory issues and long transactions.
3. Script must handle upserts (`INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`) because Phase 1 is already writing new data.

**Phase 3: Verification (Shadow Reads)**
1. Modify application repository to perform "Shadow Reads".
2. When a read is requested, fetch from Old DB (return to user) AND fetch from New DB asynchronously.
3. Compare results. Log mismatches and latency differences.
4. Run for several days until mismatch rate is 0%.

**Phase 4: Read Cutover**
1. Change feature flag so New DB is the source of truth for reads.
2. Old DB is still receiving writes as a fallback.
3. Monitor error rates and latency closely. Roll back flag if issues occur.

**Phase 5: Decommission**
1. Stop writing to Old DB.
2. Keep Old DB online for 30 days as a cold backup.
3. Delete Old DB. Delete dual-write code from application.

### Monolith to Microservice: Strangler Fig Application
**Goal**: Carve out the "Billing" bounded context from a 2-million-line monolithic API.

**Step 1: Create the Façade (API Gateway)**
- Route all traffic through an API Gateway (e.g., Nginx, Kong) pointing to the Monolith.

**Step 2: Isolate the Code within the Monolith**
- Refactor the monolith internally to ensure "Billing" has strict boundaries.
- No direct database joins between Billing tables and other tables. Enforce usage of internal service interfaces.

**Step 3: Build the Microservice**
- Create the new `billing-api` service.
- Use the strangler pattern at the database level (e.g., CDC - Change Data Capture via Debezium) to sync the monolith's billing tables to the new microservice's database.

**Step 4: Redirect Routes**
- Configure API Gateway: Route `/api/billing/*` to the new `billing-api`.
- Keep Routing `/api/*` to the Monolith.
- Support instant rollback at the Gateway level if `billing-api` fails.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).
