## Core Principles

### 1. Small Steps, Always Green
Every refactoring step keeps all tests passing.

```
WORKFLOW:
  1. Run tests → all GREEN
  2. Make ONE small change (rename, extract, inline)
  3. Run tests → still GREEN
  4. Commit
  5. Repeat
  
NEVER: make a big change and hope tests will pass later.
```

### 2. Tests Before Refactoring
No refactoring without a safety net.

```
IF tests exist → run them, verify coverage on area being changed
IF no tests → write characterization tests FIRST (assert what IS)
IF untestable → use dependency-breaking techniques to make testable
THEN refactor
```

### 3. Catalog of Transforms
Each refactoring is a well-defined, reversible transformation.

```
COMMON REFACTORINGS:
  Extract Method:    Long method → smaller methods
  Extract Class:     Large class → smaller classes
  Inline Method:     Trivial delegation → inline
  Move Method:       Method in wrong class → move to right class
  Replace Conditional with Polymorphism: if/switch → strategy pattern
  Introduce Parameter Object: 5+ params → object
  Replace Temp with Query: temp variable → method call
```


## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Step 1: Preparation
```
1. Review current state and identify gaps
2. Gather requirements from stakeholders
3. Define success criteria (measurable)
4. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
```

### Step 2: Execution
```
1. Follow the patterns and principles above
2. Document decisions as ADRs
3. Implement with tests
4. Review with relevant specialist agent
```

### Step 3: Validation
```
1. Run relevant checklist
2. Verify against success criteria
3. Get sign-off from eng-audit
4. Document learnings
```

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Agent |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| New project | Start with defaults in this guide | See agent field |
| Legacy system | Assess first, then incrementally adopt | eng-refactor |
| Emergency fix | Abbreviated version, full review within 48h | eng-audit |

## FAQ

### Q: When should I deviate from these guidelines?

## Blueprint: Legacy Code Modernization Playbook

### 1. Strangler Fig Implementation Guide

```
PHASE MAP:
===========================================================
Month 1-2: Setup
  □ Deploy proxy/router in front of legacy
  □ First route through new system (simplest endpoint)
  □ Dual-write verification (legacy + new produce same results)
  □ Monitoring: compare responses from both systems

Month 3-4: Core Migration
  □ Migrate high-value routes (most traffic)
  □ Each route: build → test → shadow → canary → full
  □ Parity tests: new system matches legacy output
  □ Performance comparison: new must be ≤ legacy latency

Month 5-6: Remaining Routes
  □ Migrate remaining routes
  □ Legacy receives < 10% traffic
  □ Plan decommission date

Month 7: Decommission
  □ All traffic through new system
  □ Legacy in read-only mode (emergency rollback)
  □ After 30 days stable: decommission legacy

ROUTE MIGRATION TEMPLATE:
  Route: GET /api/v1/products
  Legacy: product-service-v1 (Java 8, monolith)
  New: product-service-v2 (Kotlin, microservice)
  
  Step 1: Build endpoint in new service
  Step 2: Shadow traffic (send to both, only return legacy)
  Step 3: Compare responses (100% match required)
  Step 4: Canary 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
  Step 5: Remove legacy route after 30 days at 100%
  
  Rollback: Revert router config (< 1 minute)
```

### 2. Dependency Breaking Techniques (Feathers)

```python
# ============================================================
# TECHNIQUE 1: Sprout Method
# Use when: need to add new behavior to legacy code
# ============================================================

# LEGACY (untestable, side effects everywhere):
class OrderProcessor:
    def process(self, order):
        # 200 lines of spaghetti...
        # Can't add loyalty points without breaking everything
        pass

# SPROUT METHOD (new behavior in new, tested method):
class OrderProcessor:
    def process(self, order):
        # 200 lines of existing spaghetti (unchanged)
        # ...
        # ONE new line added:
        self._award_loyalty_points(order)  # Sprouted method
    
    def _award_loyalty_points(self, order):
        # NEW method — fully tested, clean code
        points = self._calculate_points(order.total)
        self._loyalty_service.add_points(order.customer_id, points)
    
    def _calculate_points(self, total):
        return int(total / 10)  # 1 point per R$10

# Tests for sprouted method (independent of legacy):
def test_loyalty_points_calculation():
    processor = OrderProcessor(loyalty_service=FakeLoyaltyService())
    assert processor._calculate_points(Decimal("100")) == 10
    assert processor._calculate_points(Decimal("99")) == 9
    assert processor._calculate_points(Decimal("0")) == 0

# ============================================================
# TECHNIQUE 2: Extract Interface
# Use when: dependency on concrete class prevents testing
# ============================================================

# BEFORE (untestable — direct dependency on PaymentGateway):
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gateway = StripePaymentGateway()  # Hardcoded!
    
    def checkout(self, order):
        result = self.gateway.charge(order.total)
        # Can't test without hitting Stripe...

# AFTER (testable — dependency on interface):
class PaymentGateway(Protocol):  # Extracted interface
    def charge(self, amount: Money) -> PaymentResult: ...

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, gateway: PaymentGateway):  # Injected!
        self.gateway = gateway
    
    def checkout(self, order):
        result = self.gateway.charge(order.total)

# Test with fake:
class FakePaymentGateway:
    def charge(self, amount): return PaymentResult(success=True, id="fake_123")

def test_checkout():
    service = OrderService(gateway=FakePaymentGateway())
    result = service.checkout(order)
    assert result.payment_id == "fake_123"

# ============================================================
# TECHNIQUE 3: Characterization Test
# Use when: no docs, no tests, code behavior unknown
# ============================================================

# LEGACY FUNCTION (nobody knows what it does):
def calculate_discount(customer, order, date, coupon=None):
    # 150 lines of mystery code...
    return result

# CHARACTERIZATION TEST (capture ACTUAL behavior):
class TestCharacterizeDiscount:
    def test_regular_customer_no_coupon(self):
        customer = Customer(type="regular", since=date(2020, 1, 1))
        order = Order(total=Decimal("100"))
        result = calculate_discount(customer, order, date(2024, 1, 15))
        assert result == Decimal("0")  # NOW WE KNOW: regular = no discount
    
    def test_vip_customer_no_coupon(self):
        customer = Customer(type="vip", since=date(2020, 1, 1))
        order = Order(total=Decimal("100"))
        result = calculate_discount(customer, order, date(2024, 1, 15))
        assert result == Decimal("15")  # NOW WE KNOW: VIP = 15% discount
    
    def test_vip_customer_with_coupon(self):
        customer = Customer(type="vip", since=date(2020, 1, 1))
        order = Order(total=Decimal("100"))
        coupon = Coupon(code="SAVE10", value=Decimal("10"))
        result = calculate_discount(customer, order, date(2024, 1, 15), coupon)
        assert result == Decimal("25")  # VIP 15% + coupon 10 = 25 (stacking!)
```


## Code Evolution Histories (Bad → Better → Best)

### Evolution 1: Error Handling

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Swallowing Errors)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error!")
        return False
```
*Why it's bad*: Swallows all context. Was it a network error? Insufficient funds? DB timeout? The caller has no idea, and the logs are useless.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Logging and Reraising)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except StripeError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Payment failed for user {user_id}: {e.message}")
        raise PaymentDeclinedException(e.message)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"System error during payment for user {user_id}", exc_info=True)
        raise SystemFailureException("Please try again later")
```
*Why it's better*: Specific exceptions caught. Logs include context and stack traces for unexpected errors. Caller gets meaningful domain exceptions.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Result Monad or Domain Errors + Outbox)**
```python
# Using a Result pattern (common in Rust/Go, implemented in Python/TS via libraries)
def process_payment(user_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> Result[PaymentReceipt, PaymentError]:
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        return Err(UserNotFoundError(user_id))
        
    charge_result = gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
    if charge_result.is_err():
        return Err(ProviderDeclinedError(charge_result.error))
        
    # Transactional Outbox pattern for DB consistency + Event publishing
    with db.transaction() as tx:
        receipt = tx.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        tx.insert_outbox_event("PaymentCompleted", receipt.to_json())
        
    return Ok(receipt)
```
*Why it's best*: No exceptions used for control flow. The type signature explicitly declares that this function can fail and dictates exactly how. ACID consistency guaranteed via outbox for side effects.

### Evolution 2: Configuration Injection

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Hardcoded / Global state)**
```python
# settings.py
DB_HOST = "localhost"
STRIPE_KEY = "sk_test_123"

# service.py
import settings
def get_user(id):
    conn = connect(settings.DB_HOST)
    # ...
```
*Why it's bad*: Impossible to test properly. Changing config means editing code. Secrets might get committed.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Environment Variables directly)**
```python
# service.py
import os
def get_user(id):
    host = os.environ.get("DB_HOST", "localhost")
    conn = connect(host)
    # ...
```
*Why it's better*: Follows 12-Factor app methodology. Code is separate from config.
*Why it's still flawed*: Scattered reads of `os.environ`. Hard to know all required env vars. Type casting is manual and error-prone. Difficult to mock in tests without messing with global `os.environ`.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Strongly Typed Config Maps injected via DI)**
```python
# config.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, SecretStr

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    db_conn_string: str
    stripe_api_key: SecretStr
    timeout_ms: int = 5000
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

# service.py
class UserService:
    # Dependency Injection
    def __init__(self, db_pool: ConnectionPool, config: AppConfig):
        self.db = db_pool
        self.config = config
        
    def get_user(self, id):
        query_timeout = self.config.timeout_ms
        # ...
```
*Why it's best*: Fail-fast on startup if env vars are missing or wrong type. Secrets are protected from accidental logging (`SecretStr`). Service is completely decoupled from *how* config is loaded, making unit testing trivial (just pass a mock `AppConfig` instance).


## Architecture Katas: Practice Scenarios

### Kata 1: The Concert Ticket Sales System
**Context**: You are building a system to sell tickets for highly anticipated concerts (e.g., Taylor Swift, BTS).
**Requirements**: 
- 5 million users attempting to buy 100,000 tickets at the exact same second the sale opens.
- Users must not be able to double-book a seat.
- Users have 10 minutes to complete payment once a seat is reserved.
- Payment processing takes up to 30 seconds.
**Constraints**: 
- Cloud-native architecture.
- 99.99% availability during the sale hour.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Handling the Thundering Herd**: How do you prevent your API and Database from melting at T-0?
   *Expected approach*: Edge caching for static content (CDN). Virtual waiting room (queue) implemented at the load balancer or via edge workers (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) to drip-feed traffic to the backend, protecting the database.
2. **Concurrency Control for Seats**: 
   *Expected approach*: Use Redis with Lua scripts or Redlock for atomic "reserve seat" operations. Relational DB (PostgreSQL) with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for assigning available seats from a pool without blocking the whole table.
3. **The 10-Minute Hold**: 
   *Expected approach*: Expiring keys in Redis (Keyspace notifications) or a delayed message queue (SQS delay seconds, RabbitMQ dead-letter exchange) to release the seat if payment isn't confirmed in 10 minutes.

### Kata 2: Global Ride-Sharing Backend (Uber clone)
**Context**: A ride-sharing app operating in 500 cities globally.
**Requirements**:
- Drivers send location updates every 3 seconds.
- Riders request rides and are matched with the nearest driver within 5 seconds.
- 1 million active drivers globally.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Location Ingestion at Scale**: 
   *Expected approach*: 1M drivers / 3sec = ~333,000 requests per second. REST is too heavy. Use WebSockets, gRPC stream, or UDP. Ingest into a distributed commit log (Kafka) to decouple ingestion from processing.
2. **Geospatial Indexing**: 
   *Expected approach*: QuadTrees, Geohashes, or H3/S2 libraries. Store active driver locations in an in-memory datastore with geospatial capabilities (Redis GEO, or a custom service holding Geohash buckets in RAM) since data is highly volatile. PostgreSQL+PostGIS is great for permanent records but too slow for 333k RPS updates.
3. **Matching Algorithm (Real-time)**: 
   *Expected approach*: Stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming) or dedicated matching worker nodes subscribed to specific Geohash partitions to calculate ETA and match.

### Kata 3: Bank Account Ledger
**Context**: A core banking system handling transfers between accounts.
**Requirements**:
- Zero lost money. Absolute consistency.
- High auditability (every change must be recorded and traceable).
- 10,000 transactions per second during peak.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Data Modeling**: 
   *Expected approach*: Event Sourcing. Accounts don't have a mutable "balance" column. The balance is a derived projection computed by summing all immutable ledger entries (credits and debits) for that account.
2. **Double-Entry Accounting**: 
   *Expected approach*: Every transaction must have at least two legs (debit Account A, credit Account B) that sum to zero. Inserted in a single ACID serializable transaction.
3. **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**: 
   *Expected approach*: Optimistic Concurrency Control (Version tracking) to allow high throughput, falling back to Pessimistic only when contention on a single "hot" account is detected.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.

# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.
