## Core Principles

### 1. Ubiquitous Language
The same language used by developers AND domain experts. No translation layer.

```
BAD:  Developer says "UserEntity" → Domain expert says "Customer"
GOOD: Both say "Customer" — in code, in conversations, in docs

HOW:
  1. Build a glossary with domain experts
  2. Use exact domain terms in code (class names, method names)
  3. Update glossary when language evolves
  4. Challenge terms that don't match the domain
```

### 2. Bounded Contexts
Each context has its own model, its own language, its own database.

```
EXAMPLE: E-commerce
  Orders Context: Order = {id, items, total, status}
  Shipping Context: Shipment = {order_id, address, tracking, carrier}
  Billing Context: Invoice = {order_id, amount, payment_method, status}
  
  "Order" means different things in each context.
  Each context owns its own definition.
  Integration via events or APIs, NEVER shared database.
```

### 3. Aggregates Protect Invariants
An aggregate is a cluster of objects treated as a single unit for consistency.

```
RULES:
  1. One root entity per aggregate (the entry point)
  2. External references by ID only (not object reference)
  3. Aggregate is the unit of consistency (transaction boundary)
  4. Keep aggregates small (prefer more, smaller aggregates)
  5. Eventual consistency BETWEEN aggregates
  6. Strong consistency WITHIN an aggregate
```

### 4. Domain Events for Integration
Bounded contexts communicate through domain events.

```
EVENT PATTERN:
  Name: Past tense (OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived, ShipmentDispatched)
  Data: Self-contained (consumer doesn't need to call back)
  Schema: Versioned (backward compatible evolution)
  Delivery: At-least-once (consumers must be idempotent)
  
  Publishing: Transactional outbox (DB + event in single transaction)
```


## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Step 1: Preparation
```
1. Review current state and identify gaps
2. Gather requirements from stakeholders
3. Define success criteria (measurable)
4. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
```

### Step 2: Execution
```
1. Follow the patterns and principles above
2. Document decisions as ADRs
3. Implement with tests
4. Review with relevant specialist agent
```

### Step 3: Validation
```
1. Run relevant checklist
2. Verify against success criteria
3. Get sign-off from eng-audit
4. Document learnings
```

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Agent |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| New project | Start with defaults in this guide | See agent field |
| Legacy system | Assess first, then incrementally adopt | eng-refactor |
| Emergency fix | Abbreviated version, full review within 48h | eng-audit |

## FAQ

### Q: When should I deviate from these guidelines?
A: Only when you have evidence that the default approach doesn't fit. Document the deviation as an ADR.

### Q: How often should these guidelines be reviewed?
A: Quarterly, or when a significant incident reveals a gap.

### Q: Who owns this document?
A: The corresponding agent specialist, reviewed by eng-chief.

## SOP: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

### Event Storming Facilitation SOP
```
BIG PICTURE EVENT STORMING:
  
  PREPARATION:
    - Book 4-hour session
    - Invite: developers + domain experts (mandatory)
    - Materials: sticky notes (orange, blue, pink, green, purple), markers, wall space
    
  COLOR CODE:
    🟧 Orange: Domain Events (past tense: "OrderPlaced")
    🟦 Blue: Commands (imperative: "PlaceOrder")
    🟪 Purple: Policies/Business Rules ("When X, then Y")
    🟩 Green: Read Models / Screens / Views
    🟨 Yellow: Actors / Personas
    🔴 Red/Pink: Pain points, questions, hot spots
  
  FLOW:
    1. (30 min) Everyone writes domain events on orange stickies
    2. (30 min) Arrange events in timeline (left to right)
    3. (30 min) Add commands (what triggers each event?)
    4. (30 min) Add actors (who triggers each command?)
    5. (30 min) Add policies (business rules connecting events)
    6. (30 min) Identify bounded contexts (group related events)
    7. (30 min) Mark pain points and questions

  OUTPUT:
    - Bounded context map (initial draft)
    - Domain events catalog
    - Pain points and questions list
    - Ubiquitous language terms (from the stickies)
```

### Aggregate Design SOP
```
RULES FOR AGGREGATE DESIGN (Vaughn Vernon):

  RULE 1: Model true invariants within a single aggregate
    Ask: "Must these two things be consistent at ALL times?"
    YES → same aggregate
    NO → separate aggregates with eventual consistency

  RULE 2: Keep aggregates small
    Target: 1 root entity + 0-3 child entities
    If aggregate grows large → split into multiple aggregates
    
  RULE 3: Reference other aggregates by ID only
    BAD:  order.customer (object reference)
    GOOD: order.customer_id (ID reference)
    WHY:  Keeps aggregates independent, allows separate scaling/persistence

  RULE 4: Maintain invariants within aggregate transaction
    One transaction = one aggregate
    Cross-aggregate = eventual consistency via domain events
    
  DESIGN PROCESS:
    1. Start with the largest aggregate (everything together)
    2. Ask: "What MUST be immediately consistent?"
    3. Split anything that can be eventually consistent
    4. Repeat until aggregates are small and focused
    5. Define domain events for cross-aggregate communication
```

### Context Mapping SOP
```
FOR EACH PAIR OF BOUNDED CONTEXTS:
  1. Which context is upstream (producer)?
  2. Which is downstream (consumer)?
  3. What is the relationship type?

RELATIONSHIP TYPES:
  SHARED KERNEL:
    Both teams share a subset of the model
    Use when: Very close collaboration, small shared code
    Risk: Changes affect both teams
    
  CUSTOMER-SUPPLIER:
    Upstream provides, downstream consumes
    Negotiation happens on changes
    Use when: Teams can negotiate priorities
    
  CONFORMIST:
    Downstream accepts upstream model as-is
    No negotiation (take it or leave it)
    Use when: Upstream is external/legacy, no influence
    
  ANTI-CORRUPTION LAYER:
    Downstream translates upstream model to its own model
    Use when: Upstream model would contaminate downstream model
    How: Adapter layer that maps between models
    
  OPEN HOST SERVICE:
    Upstream provides well-defined protocol
    Use when: Many consumers need integration
    How: Versioned API with documentation
    
  PUBLISHED LANGUAGE:
    Shared language (schema) for integration
    Use when: Industry standard format exists
    Example: FHIR for healthcare, FIX for financial

```


## Code Evolution Histories (Bad → Better → Best)

### Evolution 1: Error Handling

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Swallowing Errors)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error!")
        return False
```
*Why it's bad*: Swallows all context. Was it a network error? Insufficient funds? DB timeout? The caller has no idea, and the logs are useless.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Logging and Reraising)**
```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount):
    try:
        user = db.get_user(user_id)
        gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
        db.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        return True
    except StripeError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Payment failed for user {user_id}: {e.message}")
        raise PaymentDeclinedException(e.message)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"System error during payment for user {user_id}", exc_info=True)
        raise SystemFailureException("Please try again later")
```
*Why it's better*: Specific exceptions caught. Logs include context and stack traces for unexpected errors. Caller gets meaningful domain exceptions.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Result Monad or Domain Errors + Outbox)**
```python
# Using a Result pattern (common in Rust/Go, implemented in Python/TS via libraries)
def process_payment(user_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> Result[PaymentReceipt, PaymentError]:
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        return Err(UserNotFoundError(user_id))
        
    charge_result = gateway.charge(user.stripe_id, amount)
    if charge_result.is_err():
        return Err(ProviderDeclinedError(charge_result.error))
        
    # Transactional Outbox pattern for DB consistency + Event publishing
    with db.transaction() as tx:
        receipt = tx.update_balance(user_id, amount)
        tx.insert_outbox_event("PaymentCompleted", receipt.to_json())
        
    return Ok(receipt)
```
*Why it's best*: No exceptions used for control flow. The type signature explicitly declares that this function can fail and dictates exactly how. ACID consistency guaranteed via outbox for side effects.

### Evolution 2: Configuration Injection

**Level 1: The "Bad" (Hardcoded / Global state)**
```python
# settings.py
DB_HOST = "localhost"
STRIPE_KEY = "sk_test_123"

# service.py
import settings
def get_user(id):
    conn = connect(settings.DB_HOST)
    # ...
```
*Why it's bad*: Impossible to test properly. Changing config means editing code. Secrets might get committed.

**Level 2: The "Better" (Environment Variables directly)**
```python
# service.py
import os
def get_user(id):
    host = os.environ.get("DB_HOST", "localhost")
    conn = connect(host)
    # ...
```
*Why it's better*: Follows 12-Factor app methodology. Code is separate from config.
*Why it's still flawed*: Scattered reads of `os.environ`. Hard to know all required env vars. Type casting is manual and error-prone. Difficult to mock in tests without messing with global `os.environ`.

**Level 3: The "Best" (Strongly Typed Config Maps injected via DI)**
```python
# config.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, BaseSettings, SecretStr

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    db_conn_string: str
    stripe_api_key: SecretStr
    timeout_ms: int = 5000
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

# service.py
class UserService:
    # Dependency Injection
    def __init__(self, db_pool: ConnectionPool, config: AppConfig):
        self.db = db_pool
        self.config = config
        
    def get_user(self, id):
        query_timeout = self.config.timeout_ms
        # ...
```
*Why it's best*: Fail-fast on startup if env vars are missing or wrong type. Secrets are protected from accidental logging (`SecretStr`). Service is completely decoupled from *how* config is loaded, making unit testing trivial (just pass a mock `AppConfig` instance).


## Architecture Katas: Practice Scenarios

### Kata 1: The Concert Ticket Sales System
**Context**: You are building a system to sell tickets for highly anticipated concerts (e.g., Taylor Swift, BTS).
**Requirements**: 
- 5 million users attempting to buy 100,000 tickets at the exact same second the sale opens.
- Users must not be able to double-book a seat.
- Users have 10 minutes to complete payment once a seat is reserved.
- Payment processing takes up to 30 seconds.
**Constraints**: 
- Cloud-native architecture.
- 99.99% availability during the sale hour.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Handling the Thundering Herd**: How do you prevent your API and Database from melting at T-0?
   *Expected approach*: Edge caching for static content (CDN). Virtual waiting room (queue) implemented at the load balancer or via edge workers (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) to drip-feed traffic to the backend, protecting the database.
2. **Concurrency Control for Seats**: 
   *Expected approach*: Use Redis with Lua scripts or Redlock for atomic "reserve seat" operations. Relational DB (PostgreSQL) with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for assigning available seats from a pool without blocking the whole table.
3. **The 10-Minute Hold**: 
   *Expected approach*: Expiring keys in Redis (Keyspace notifications) or a delayed message queue (SQS delay seconds, RabbitMQ dead-letter exchange) to release the seat if payment isn't confirmed in 10 minutes.

### Kata 2: Global Ride-Sharing Backend (Uber clone)
**Context**: A ride-sharing app operating in 500 cities globally.
**Requirements**:
- Drivers send location updates every 3 seconds.
- Riders request rides and are matched with the nearest driver within 5 seconds.
- 1 million active drivers globally.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Location Ingestion at Scale**: 
   *Expected approach*: 1M drivers / 3sec = ~333,000 requests per second. REST is too heavy. Use WebSockets, gRPC stream, or UDP. Ingest into a distributed commit log (Kafka) to decouple ingestion from processing.
2. **Geospatial Indexing**: 
   *Expected approach*: QuadTrees, Geohashes, or H3/S2 libraries. Store active driver locations in an in-memory datastore with geospatial capabilities (Redis GEO, or a custom service holding Geohash buckets in RAM) since data is highly volatile. PostgreSQL+PostGIS is great for permanent records but too slow for 333k RPS updates.
3. **Matching Algorithm (Real-time)**: 
   *Expected approach*: Stream processing (Flink/Spark Streaming) or dedicated matching worker nodes subscribed to specific Geohash partitions to calculate ETA and match.

### Kata 3: Bank Account Ledger
**Context**: A core banking system handling transfers between accounts.
**Requirements**:
- Zero lost money. Absolute consistency.
- High auditability (every change must be recorded and traceable).
- 10,000 transactions per second during peak.
**Key Architectural Decisions Required**:
1. **Data Modeling**: 
   *Expected approach*: Event Sourcing. Accounts don't have a mutable "balance" column. The balance is a derived projection computed by summing all immutable ledger entries (credits and debits) for that account.
2. **Double-Entry Accounting**: 
   *Expected approach*: Every transaction must have at least two legs (debit Account A, credit Account B) that sum to zero. Inserted in a single ACID serializable transaction.
3. **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**: 
   *Expected approach*: Optimistic Concurrency Control (Version tracking) to allow high throughput, falling back to Pessimistic only when contention on a single "hot" account is detected.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).



# Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Cloud Security Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** BeyondCorp (Google)
## 1. The Core Philosophy
The traditional "Castle and Moat" security model is obsolete.
## 2. The Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) Model
Replacing the traditional VPN.
## 3. Context-Aware Access (Zero Trust Evaluation)
Before granting access, the policy engine evaluates Identity Risk, Device Posture, Time/Context.
## 4. Workload-to-Workload Security (Micro-segmentation)
### 4.1 Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
mTLS Everywhere.
### 4.2 Network Policies (Kubernetes)
Enforce strict NetworkPolicy resources.
## 5. Secrets Management Architecture
HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager. Vault generates dynamic, short-lived credentials.
## 6. The Supply Chain Threat Model
Code Signing, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM.

# The Complete Platform Engineering Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Team Topologies, DORA
## 1. Executive Summary
Platform Engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era. Its goal is to reduce cognitive load and provide a paved path (Golden Path) to production.
## 2. Core Principles of Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
### Principle 1: Treat the Platform as a Product
The platform must be treated as a product built for customers (the developers). It requires: Product Manager, User research, Marketing, Metrics.
### Principle 2: Self-Service First
Developers should NOT need to open a Jira ticket to provision a new database, create a new CI/CD pipeline, get a staging environment, or request temporary elevated privileges.
### Principle 3: The Golden Path (Paved Road)
The Golden Path is an opinionated, well-integrated set of tools and best practices. Rule: Developers can choose to build outside the Golden Path, but they lose platform support.
## 3. The Portal (Developer Control Plane)
An IDP requires a single pane of glass (e.g., Backstage by Spotify).
### 3.1 Software Catalog
A centralized registry of all software components. Metadata required: Service owner, lifecycle state, PagerDuty link, Runbook link.
### 3.2 Scaffolding (Templates)
One-click creation of new services.
## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Architecture
### 4.1 Terraform Module Registry
The Platform team publishes opinionated Terraform modules.
### 4.2 GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD / Flux)
Pull vs Push: Instead of CI pushing to Kubernetes, Kubernetes pulls state from a Git repository.
## 5. Platform Metrics that Matter
1. Developer Onboarding Time: Time it takes a new hire to merge their first PR to production.
2. Setup Time: Time to provision a fully working local dev environment.
3. Platform Adoption Rate: % of teams using the Golden Path.



# The Data Mesh & Data Lakehouse Architecture Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Zhamak Dehghani
## 1. The Death of the Centralized Data Lake
Centralized data engineering teams become bottlenecks.
## 2. The Four Pillars of Data Mesh
### Pillar 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership
Data is owned by the domain team that produces it, not by a central data team.
### Pillar 2: Data as a Product
Analytical data must be treated as a first-class product. Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing.
### Pillar 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform
A dedicated team builds the underlying data platform.
### Pillar 4: Federated Computational Governance
Global policies enforced locally.
## 3. The Data Lakehouse Transition
Merging the flexibility of Data Lakes with the management capabilities of Data Warehouses.
### 3.1 Table Formats (Iceberg / Delta Lake / Hudi)
Instead of raw Parquet files in S3, use open table formats like Apache Iceberg.
### 3.2 The Medallion Architecture (Databricks pattern)
1. Bronze Layer (Raw). 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed). 3. Gold Layer (Business Level).



# CQRS and Event Sourcing Playbook
**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Author:** Software Engineering Squad | **Source Frameworks:** Greg Young, Udi Dahan
## 1. When to Use (and NOT use) CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation separates models for updating data from models for reading data.
### 1.1 Do NOT use CQRS if:
Your domain is simple CRUD. Your reads and writes have the same shape. You don't need historical auditability.
### 1.2 USE CQRS if:
High contention, Asymmetric scale, Complex read projections.
## 2. Event Sourcing (ES) Deep Dive
Instead of storing the current state of an entity, you store the sequence of events that led to that state.
### 2.1 The Event Store
An append-only database. Events are immutable.
### 2.2 Rehydration (State Reconstruction)
To get current state: Load all events for an Aggregate ID and fold/reduce them sequentially.
## 3. Projections (The Read Model in CQRS)
The "Query" side of CQRS.
## 4. CAP Theorem Implications
CQRS structurally embraces Eventual Consistency (AP over CP).
