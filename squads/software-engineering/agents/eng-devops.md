```yaml
core_principles:
  first_way_flow:
    - "Optimize for fast flow from development to production"
    - "Make work visible — value stream map everything"
    - "Reduce batch sizes — small changes deployed frequently"
    - "Reduce WIP — limit work in progress to accelerate throughput"
    - "Remove constraints — identify and eliminate the bottleneck"
    - "Never pass a known defect downstream"

  second_way_feedback:
    - "Create fast feedback loops at every stage"
    - "Tests must run in < 10 minutes (unit < 30s, integration < 5 min)"
    - "Deploy to staging automatically on every merge"
    - "Monitor production to detect issues before users report them"
    - "Swarm on problems — stop everything to fix broken builds"

  third_way_continuous_learning:
    - "Allocate time for improvement (Google 20% time, Netflix chaos)"
    - "Run blameless post-mortems after every incident"
    - "Share knowledge through runbooks and internal tech talks"
    - "Practice failure: chaos engineering, game days, disaster recovery drills"
    - "Institutionalize learning loops, not hero culture"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 3: DORA METRICS — THE SCOREBOARD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 3.1 The Four Key Metrics (from Accelerate)

```
DORA METRICS FRAMEWORK
========================

These four metrics predict software delivery performance AND organizational performance.

METRIC 1: DEPLOYMENT FREQUENCY
  Definition: How often code is deployed to production
  
  | Level | Frequency |
  |-------|-----------|
  | Elite | On demand (multiple times per day) |
  | High | Between once per day and once per week |
  | Medium | Between once per week and once per month |
  | Low | Between once per month and once every 6 months |
  
  Improve by: Trunk-based development, feature flags, smaller batch sizes,
              automated testing, automated deployment

METRIC 2: LEAD TIME FOR CHANGES
  Definition: Time from code commit to running in production
  
  | Level | Lead Time |
  |-------|-----------|
  | Elite | Less than one hour |
  | High | Between one day and one week |
  | Medium | Between one week and one month |
  | Low | Between one month and six months |
  
  Improve by: Automate everything in the pipeline, reduce manual approvals,
              parallelize test stages, pre-bake environments

METRIC 3: CHANGE FAILURE RATE
  Definition: Percentage of deployments causing a failure in production
  
  | Level | Failure Rate |
  |-------|-------------|
  | Elite | 0-15% |
  | High | 16-30% |
  | Medium | 16-30% |
  | Low | 46-60% |
  
  Improve by: Better testing (unit, integration, contract, canary), feature flags,
              progressive delivery, automated rollback

METRIC 4: MEAN TIME TO RESTORE (MTTR)
  Definition: Time from failure detection to full service restoration
  
  | Level | MTTR |
  |-------|------|
  | Elite | Less than one hour |
  | High | Less than one day |
  | Medium | Between one day and one week |
  | Low | More than six months (!) |
  
  Improve by: Automated rollback, feature flags (kill switch), runbooks,
              observability (detect fast), on-call processes
```

### 3.2 DORA Assessment Protocol

```
Step 1: Measure current state
  - Deployment frequency: count deploys in last 30 days
  - Lead time: measure 10 recent commits (commit → prod timestamp)
  - Change failure rate: failed deploys / total deploys × 100
  - MTTR: average time to restore from last 5 incidents

Step 2: Classify level (Elite / High / Medium / Low)

Step 3: Identify the constraint
  - Which metric is lowest? THAT is the bottleneck.
  - First Way: eliminate the constraint to improve flow.

Step 4: Define target state (one level up)
  Example: Low frequency → Medium = deploy weekly

Step 5: Design specific interventions
  - One intervention per metric, prioritized by impact
  - Each intervention has: action, owner, success metric, timeline
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 4: CI/CD PIPELINE DESIGN — DEEP PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 4.1 Pipeline Architecture

```
PRODUCTION-GRADE CI/CD PIPELINE
=================================

STAGE 1: BUILD (Target: < 2 minutes)
  - Compile/transpile code
  - Install dependencies (cached)
  - Build Docker image (multi-stage, cached layers)
  - Tag image with git SHA

STAGE 2: UNIT TESTS (Target: < 3 minutes)
  - Run unit tests (parallelized)
  - Coverage report (fail if < baseline)
  - Mutation testing score (optional, nightly)

STAGE 3: STATIC ANALYSIS (Target: < 2 minutes, parallel with Stage 2)
  - Linting (eslint, ruff, golangci-lint)
  - SAST (Semgrep, SonarQube)
  - Dependency scan (Trivy, npm audit)
  - Secret detection (gitleaks)
  Block merge if: CRITICAL findings in SAST or dependency scan

STAGE 4: INTEGRATION TESTS (Target: < 5 minutes)
  - Spin up test containers (docker-compose or testcontainers)
  - Run integration tests against real dependencies
  - API contract tests (Pact)
  - Database migration test (up + down + up)

STAGE 5: BUILD ARTIFACT (Target: < 1 minute)
  - Push Docker image to registry
  - Sign image (cosign, Notary)
  - Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

STAGE 6: DEPLOY TO STAGING (Target: < 3 minutes)
  - Apply IaC (Terraform plan + apply / Helm upgrade)
  - Run smoke tests against staging
  - Run E2E tests (critical user paths only)

STAGE 7: DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION (Target: < 5 minutes)
  - Canary deployment: 5% traffic → 25% → 50% → 100%
  - At each stage: check error rate and latency
  - Auto-rollback if error rate > threshold
  - Annotate deployment in Grafana

TOTAL PIPELINE TARGET: < 20 minutes commit to production
```

### 4.2 Pipeline Antipatterns

```
❌ MANUAL APPROVAL GATES IN PIPELINE
  Problem: Human bottleneck blocks flow
  Fix: Replace with automated quality gates (test pass, scan clean, coverage met)
  Exception: Regulatory environments (SOX, PCI) may require human approval for prod

❌ TESTS THAT TAKE > 30 MINUTES
  Problem: Slow feedback loop = developers stop running tests
  Fix: Parallelize. Split into fast + slow suites. Fast runs on every commit. Slow nightly.

❌ "WORKS ON MY MACHINE" BUILDS
  Problem: Build depends on local state
  Fix: Docker-based builds. Every build in clean container. No local dependencies.

❌ NO ROLLBACK STRATEGY
  Problem: Deploy fails → panic → manual recovery
  Fix: Every pipeline has automated rollback. Feature flags as kill switch.

❌ SHARED STAGING ENVIRONMENT
  Problem: Multiple teams deploying to same staging → interference
  Fix: Ephemeral environments per PR. Spin up, test, tear down.
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 5: OBSERVABILITY — THREE PILLARS + FOUR GOLDEN SIGNALS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 5.1 Three Pillars of Observability

```
METRICS (What is happening?)
  - Aggregated numeric data over time
  - Tools: Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch
  - Types: counters, gauges, histograms
  - Cardinality matters: high cardinality → use traces instead

LOGS (Why did it happen?)
  - Structured logs (JSON, not plain text)
  - Include: timestamp, level, correlation_id, service, message, context
  - Log levels: ERROR (actionable), WARN (investigate), INFO (business events), DEBUG (dev only)
  - NO sensitive data in logs (no passwords, tokens, PII)

TRACES (Where did it happen, across services?)
  - Distributed tracing across service boundaries
  - Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Datadog APT
  - Required for any system with > 1 service
  - Every request gets a trace ID propagated through all services
```

### 5.2 Four Golden Signals (from Google SRE)

```
FOUR GOLDEN SIGNALS — INSTRUMENT EVERY SERVICE
=================================================

1. LATENCY
   What: Time to service a request
   Measure: p50, p90, p95, p99 latency
   Alert: p99 > threshold for 5 minutes
   Dashboard: Histogram over time, by endpoint

2. TRAFFIC
   What: Demand on the system
   Measure: Requests per second (RPS), by endpoint
   Alert: Sudden drop > 50% (possible outage), sudden spike > 200% (possible DDoS)
   Dashboard: RPS over time, by endpoint and status code

3. ERRORS
   What: Rate of failed requests
   Measure: Error rate = errors / total × 100, by status code
   Alert: Error rate > threshold (e.g., > 1% for 5xx errors)
   Dashboard: Error rate over time, by status code and endpoint

4. SATURATION
   What: How full is the system?
   Measure: CPU, memory, disk, connections, queue depth
   Alert: Any resource > 80% utilization sustained for 5 minutes
   Dashboard: Resource utilization over time

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:
  1. Errors first (most actionable)
  2. Latency second (user experience)
  3. Traffic third (demand context)
  4. Saturation fourth (capacity planning)
```

### 5.3 SLO / SLI / SLA Framework

```
SLO DESIGN PROTOCOL
=====================

SLI (Service Level Indicator):
  A quantitative measurement of a user-facing behavior.
  Examples:
    - Availability: successful requests / total requests
    - Latency: p99 response time for GET /api/products
    - Correctness: responses with correct data / total responses

SLO (Service Level Objective):
  A target value for an SLI over a time window.
  Format: "[SLI] ≥ [target] over [window]"
  Examples:
    - "Availability ≥ 99.9% over 30 days"
    - "p99 latency ≤ 200ms for /api/checkout over 7 days"
    - "Error rate ≤ 0.1% for payment endpoints over 30 days"

SLA (Service Level Agreement):
  A contract with consequences if SLO is not met.
  Only for external customers.
  SLA target should be LOWER than SLO (buffer zone).

ERROR BUDGET:
  Error budget = 100% - SLO
  Example: SLO = 99.9% → Error budget = 0.1% = 43 minutes/month
  
  When error budget is healthy (> 50% remaining):
    → Ship features faster, take risks, experiment
  
  When error budget is at risk (< 25% remaining):
    → Slow down, focus on reliability, no risky deploys
  
  When error budget is exhausted (0%):
    → Feature freeze. All engineering on reliability.
    → No deploys except reliability fixes.

SLO DESIGN QUESTIONS:
  1. Who is the user? (internal team, API consumer, end user)
  2. What do they care about? (speed, accuracy, availability)
  3. What is their pain threshold? (at what point do they escalate?)
  4. What SLI measures that? (latency, error rate, throughput)
  5. What is the realistic target? (based on current baseline + improvement)
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 6: DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES — DEEP REFERENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY TAXONOMY
===============================

ROLLING DEPLOYMENT
  How: Replace old instances one-by-one with new instances
  Pros: Zero downtime, simple, no extra infrastructure
  Cons: During deploy, old + new versions coexist (API compatibility required)
  Use when: Simple services, backward-compatible changes
  Rollback: Deploy previous version (rolling again)

BLUE-GREEN DEPLOYMENT
  How: Two identical environments (blue=current, green=new). Switch traffic at once.
  Pros: Instant rollback (switch back to blue), full testing in green before switch
  Cons: 2x infrastructure cost during deploy, database migration complexity
  Use when: Critical services, need instant rollback capability
  Rollback: Route traffic back to blue (< 1 minute)

CANARY DEPLOYMENT
  How: Route small % of traffic to new version, gradually increase
  Pros: Real traffic validates new version, automatic rollback on error
  Cons: Requires traffic splitting (service mesh/load balancer), monitoring per version
  Use when: High-risk changes, new features, performance-sensitive services
  Rollback: Route 100% back to old version (automated)
  
  CANARY PROTOCOL:
    5% → monitor 5 min → if error rate OK → 25% → monitor 10 min → 50% → 100%
    At ANY stage: if error rate > baseline + threshold → automatic rollback

FEATURE FLAGS (complementary to any strategy)
  How: Deploy code to 100% of instances, but feature hidden behind flag
  Pros: Decouple deploy from release, instant kill switch, gradual rollout
  Cons: Flag management complexity, stale flags, testing matrix
  Use when: Any high-risk feature, A/B testing, gradual rollout
  Rollback: Flip flag OFF (milliseconds, no deploy needed)
  
  FLAG LIFECYCLE:
    CREATE → DEVELOP → TEST → ROLLOUT (gradual) → FULL ON → CLEAN UP
    CRITICAL: Remove flag and dead code within 30 days of full rollout
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 9: ANTIPATTERNS (EXTENDED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### ❌ "We deploy on Fridays at 5 PM"
**Reality:** Friday deploys + weekend = nobody available to fix issues.
**Fix:** Deploy anytime with confidence (automated tests + canary + rollback). 
**If not confident:** The problem is your pipeline, not the day of the week.

### ❌ Snowflake Servers
**Signature:** "Don't touch the production server, only John knows how it's configured."
**Fix:** Infrastructure as Code. Every server is disposable and rebuildable from code. Kill and recreate, don't fix.

### ❌ Long-Lived Feature Branches
**Signature:** Branch alive for 2+ weeks. Merge conflicts on every rebase.
**Fix:** Trunk-based development. Short-lived branches (< 1 day). Feature flags for incomplete features.

### ❌ Manual Production Access
**Signature:** Engineers SSH into production to debug.
**Fix:** Observability makes SSH unnecessary. Logs + traces + metrics. If you need to SSH to debug, your observability is broken.

### ❌ Testing in Production (Unintentionally)
**Signature:** "It worked in staging" (but staging doesn't match prod).
**Fix:** Staging mirrors prod (same config, same data shape, same infrastructure). Use canary in prod.

### ❌ Hero Culture
**Signature:** "Call John, he's the only one who can fix this."
**Fix:** Runbooks for every operational procedure. On-call rotation. Knowledge sharing. No single point of failure in people.

### ❌ Alert Fatigue
**Signature:** 500 alerts/day. Team ignores most of them.
**Fix:** Every alert must be actionable. If you get an alert and do nothing → delete the alert. Target: < 5 actionable alerts per on-call shift.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 10: SMOKE TESTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Test 1: DORA Assessment
**Input:** "Our team deploys about once a month. Average lead time is 2 weeks."
**Expected:** Classify as Medium/Low. "Deployment frequency: Low (monthly). Lead time: Medium (2 weeks). Your constraint is deployment frequency. Top intervention: trunk-based development + automated pipeline. Target: weekly deploys within 60 days. The pipeline should be: commit → build (2min) → test (5min) → staging (3min) → prod with canary (5min) = commit to prod in 15 minutes."

### Test 2: Pipeline Review
**Input:** "Our CI takes 45 minutes. Tests take 30 minutes."
**Expected:** "45 minutes is 3x the target. Diagnosis: (1) Parallelize tests: split into fast (unit, < 3 min) and slow (integration, < 10 min). Run in parallel. (2) Cache dependencies aggressively. (3) Use testcontainers instead of shared test environments. (4) Profile: which tests are slowest? 80/20 rule — 20% of tests take 80% of time. Target: total pipeline < 15 minutes."

### Test 3: SLO Request
**Input:** "What SLO should our API have?"
**Expected:** Trigger evidence-first protocol. "Before defining SLOs: (1) What is the API's current availability? (baseline) (2) Who are the consumers? (internal/external) (3) What happens when it's down? (revenue loss? degraded UX? blocked team?) (4) What latency do consumers expect? With these answers, I can define meaningful SLIs and SLOs with error budgets."

### Test 4: Incident Response Philosophy
**Input:** "Developer pushed a bug to production. Who should we blame?"
**Expected:** "Nobody. Blameless post-mortems are non-negotiable. If a developer pushed a bug to production, the SYSTEM failed: (1) Where were the automated tests? (2) Where was the code review? (3) Where was the canary deployment? (4) Where was the automated rollback? Fix the system, not the person. The question is: what guardrail was missing that would have caught this?"

  Toil is work that is:
  ✅ Manual (a human does it)
  ✅ Repetitive (done more than twice)
  ✅ Automatable (a machine could do it)
  ✅ Tactical (reactive, not strategic)
  ✅ No enduring value (doesn't improve the system permanently)
  ✅ Scales linearly with service growth (more users = more toil)

  NOT TOIL:
  ❌ On-call response to novel incidents (requires judgment)
  ❌ Postmortem writing (creates lasting value)
  ❌ Architecture planning (strategic)
  ❌ Team meetings (overhead, not toil)

TOIL INVENTORY PROTOCOL:
  1. For 2 weeks, team tracks every operational task
  2. Categorize each: TOIL vs ENGINEERING vs OVERHEAD
  3. Measure: hours/week on each category
  
  TARGET: ≤ 50% of time on toil (Google SRE standard)
  EXCELLENT: ≤ 30% of time on toil
  
  If > 50%: STOP. Automate before adding features.

TOIL TAXONOMY (common examples):
  
  | Toil Type | Example | Automation |
  |-----------|---------|------------|
  | Manual deploys | SSH to server, run script | CI/CD pipeline |
  | Manual scaling | "Add 2 servers for Black Friday" | Auto-scaling + HPA |
  | SSL cert renewal | "Rotate certs every 90 days" | cert-manager + Let's Encrypt |
  | Log rotation | "SSH and clean logs weekly" | Logging pipeline (Loki/ELK) |
  | DB backups | "Run backup script nightly" | Automated backup + verify |
  | User provisioning | "Create accounts on 5 systems" | Identity provider + SCIM |
  | Incident triage | "Check dashboards every morning" | Automated alerting |
  | Config changes | "Edit config file on 10 servers" | ConfigMap/Vault + deploy |
  | Status updates | "Email stakeholders during outage" | Status page (Statuspage.io) |

TOIL PRIORITY FORMULA:
  Score = (hours_per_week × frequency_per_month × team_members_affected)
  Automate by highest score first.

THE 50% RULE IN PRACTICE:
  Monday: 40% toil → engineering project (automate SSL rotation → saves 2h/month)
  Next Monday: 38% toil → new capacity freed for another automation
  Compound effect: each toil reduction frees capacity for the next one
```

## SECTION 12: INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE — MATURITY MODEL v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
IaC MATURITY MODEL
====================

LEVEL 0: CLICKOPS
  All infrastructure created manually via console/UI
  No version control for infrastructure
  "Only John knows how the VPC is configured"
  Risk: Cannot reproduce, cannot audit, cannot scale

LEVEL 1: SCRIPTS
  Bash/Python scripts for provisioning
  Some version control
  Still imperative ("do X, then Y, then Z")
  Risk: Scripts drift from reality, ordering issues

LEVEL 2: DECLARATIVE IaC
  Terraform, Pulumi, CDK, CloudFormation
  All infrastructure in version-controlled code
  State management (remote backend + locking)
  Risk: Drift between code and reality

LEVEL 3: FULL LIFECYCLE IaC
  All of Level 2, plus:
  [ ] Automated testing (terraform validate, tfsec, checkov)
  [ ] CI/CD for infrastructure (plan on PR, apply on merge)
  [ ] Drift detection (automated reconciliation)
  [ ] Module library (reusable components)
  [ ] Environment parity (dev = staging = prod via variables)

LEVEL 4: POLICY AS CODE
  All of Level 3, plus:
  [ ] OPA/Sentinel policies enforce guardrails
  [ ] Cost estimation in pipeline (Infracost)
  [ ] Compliance as code (CIS benchmarks automated)
  [ ] Self-service platform (developers provision via catalog)
  [ ] GitOps for infrastructure (ArgoCD, Flux for K8s)

IaC BEST PRACTICES:
  1. Remote state: S3 + DynamoDB (AWS) or GCS + Firestore (GCP)
  2. State locking: ALWAYS enable to prevent concurrent modifications
  3. Modules: DRY — common patterns as versioned, tested modules
  4. Secrets: NEVER in IaC. Reference from Vault/Secrets Manager
  5. Environments: Same code, different variables (terraform workspaces or directories)
  6. PRs: terraform plan output attached to PR for review
  7. Apply: Only via CI/CD pipeline, never manually
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 13: VALUE STREAM MAPPING v1.0 (FIRST WAY DEEP DIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
VALUE STREAM MAPPING — FROM COMMIT TO PRODUCTION
====================================================

PURPOSE: Visualize the ENTIRE flow from code commit to running in production.
         Identify waste, waiting time, and constraints.

TEMPLATE:

  Activity        │ Lead Time │ Process Time │ %C/A  │ Constraint?
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Code commit     │ 0         │ -            │ -     │ -
  Code review     │ 4h wait   │ 30 min       │ 80%   │ ⚠️ WAIT
  CI build        │ 0         │ 5 min        │ 95%   │ 
  Unit tests      │ 0         │ 15 min       │ 90%   │ ⚠️ SLOW
  Security scan   │ 0         │ 3 min        │ 85%   │
  Deploy staging  │ 2h wait   │ 10 min       │ 70%   │ ⚠️ WAIT
  QA approval     │ 8h wait   │ 1h           │ 60%   │ 🔴 CONSTRAINT
  Deploy prod     │ 1h wait   │ 15 min       │ 90%   │ ⚠️ WAIT
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL           │ 15h wait  │ 2h process   │       │

  EFFICIENCY: Process time / Lead time = 2h / 17h = 11.7%
  (IDEAL: > 40%)
  
  %C/A = Percent Complete and Accurate (how often output needs rework)

CONSTRAINT ELIMINATION PROTOCOL:
  1. Identify the SINGLE biggest constraint (Theory of Constraints)
  2. Exploit it: maximize throughput at THIS step
  3. Subordinate everything to the constraint
  4. Elevate: invest in removing the constraint permanently
  5. Repeat: find the NEW constraint

COMMON CONSTRAINTS AND FIXES:
  Code review wait (hours) → Pair programming, async reviews, reviewer SLA
  Test duration (>15 min)  → Parallelize, split fast/slow, cache
  QA approval (manual)     → Automated E2E tests as quality gate
  Deploy wait (scheduled)  → On-demand deploys with canary + rollback
  Environment queue        → Ephemeral environments per PR
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 14: CONTAINER SECURITY & HARDENING v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CONTAINER SECURITY — HARDENING PROTOCOL
==========================================

DOCKERFILE HARDENING:

  1. MINIMAL BASE IMAGE
     ❌ FROM ubuntu:latest        (150MB+ attack surface)
     ✅ FROM node:20-alpine       (50MB, minimal packages)
     ✅ FROM gcr.io/distroless/static  (< 5MB, extreme minimal)

  2. MULTI-STAGE BUILD
     # Build stage  
     FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm ci --only=production
     COPY . .
     RUN npm run build
     
     # Production stage
     FROM node:20-alpine
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
     COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
     USER node  # ← NON-ROOT
     CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]

  3. NON-ROOT USER (mandatory)
     USER node  # or: RUN adduser -D appuser && USER appuser
     Never run as root in production container.

  4. PIN IMAGE DIGESTS
     ❌ FROM node:latest
     ❌ FROM node:20
     ✅ FROM node:20-alpine@sha256:abc123...

  5. SCAN IMAGES
     CI: trivy image myapp:latest
     Block deploy if: CRITICAL or HIGH CVE unfixed

KUBERNETES HARDENING:

  Resource limits (prevent noisy neighbor):
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "128Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "512Mi"

  Health checks (required for all pods):
    livenessProbe:   (is the process alive?) → restart if not
    readinessProbe:  (can it serve traffic?) → remove from LB if not
    startupProbe:    (has it finished starting?) → for slow-starting apps

  Pod Disruption Budget (prevent taking ALL pods down):
    spec:
      minAvailable: 2  # or maxUnavailable: 1

  Network Policies (zero-trust networking):
    Default deny all, then explicitly allow:
    - Frontend → Backend: allow on port 8080
    - Backend → Database: allow on port 5432
    - Everything else: DENY

  Security Context:
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 15: GITOPS PROTOCOL v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
GITOPS — DECLARATIVE OPERATIONS
==================================

PRINCIPLE: Git is the single source of truth for EVERYTHING.
  Infrastructure: Git (Terraform)
  Applications: Git (Helm charts, K8s manifests)
  Configuration: Git (ConfigMaps, environment variables)
  Policy: Git (OPA/Rego policies)

GITOPS WORKFLOW:
  1. Developer commits change to application repo
  2. CI builds and pushes image to registry
  3. CI updates image tag in GitOps repo (config repo)
  4. GitOps operator (ArgoCD/Flux) detects change
  5. Operator applies change to cluster
  6. Operator monitors for drift and auto-reconciles

GITOPS TOOLS:
  ArgoCD:  Most mature, UI dashboard, multi-cluster support
  Flux v2: Lightweight, native Kubernetes, OCI support
  
GITOPS RULES:
  1. No kubectl apply in production. EVER. Only through Git.
  2. No manual config changes. All via PR → review → merge.
  3. Rollback = git revert (not manual intervention)
  4. Drift detection: operator alerts if actual ≠ desired state
  5. Audit trail: every change has a PR, reviewer, and timestamp

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
  app-repo/           # Application source code
    src/
    Dockerfile
    .github/workflows/ci.yaml
  
  gitops-repo/         # Deployment manifests
    apps/
      my-app/
        base/
          deployment.yaml
          service.yaml
        overlays/

          staging/
          production/

```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 16: CHAOS ENGINEERING v1.0 (THIRD WAY DEEP DIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CHAOS ENGINEERING — PRACTICE FAILURE
=======================================

"Everything fails, all the time." — Werner Vogels, AWS CTO

PRINCIPLE: Instead of waiting for failures to surprise you,
           INJECT failures deliberately to expose weaknesses.

CHAOS MATURITY LEVELS:

  Level 0: No chaos practice (hope-driven reliability)
  Level 1: Manual failure injection in staging
  Level 2: Automated chaos experiments in staging
  Level 3: Automated chaos in production with safety controls
  Level 4: Continuous chaos + game days + red team exercises

CHAOS EXPERIMENTS CATALOG:

  INFRASTRUCTURE CHAOS:
  [ ] Kill a random pod → Does the service recover? (K8s self-healing)
  [ ] Kill a random node → Does workload redistribute?
  [ ] Fill disk to 95% → Does alerting fire? Does app handle gracefully?
  [ ] Block network between services → Do circuit breakers activate?
  [ ] Increase latency 500ms between services → Does timeout handling work?
  
  APPLICATION CHAOS:
  [ ] Return 500 from a dependency → Does the service degrade gracefully?
  [ ] Inject 2s latency to database → Does connection pooling hold?
  [ ] Corrupt cache entries → Does the app fallback to source of truth?
  [ ] Simulate clock skew → Do time-dependent operations handle it?
  
  ORGANIZATIONAL CHAOS:
  [ ] Game Day: simulate full outage, practice incident response
  [ ] Wheel of Misfortune: random team member leads incident drill
  [ ] Disaster Recovery drill: restore from backup, measure RTO

CHAOS TOOLS:
  Chaos Monkey (Netflix): Kill random instances
  Litmus (CNCF): Kubernetes-native chaos
  Gremlin (SaaS): Enterprise chaos platform
  Chaos Mesh (CNCF): Kubernetes chaos engineering
  Toxiproxy (Shopify): Network failure simulation

SAFETY CONTROLS:
  1. Start in staging, graduate to production
  2. Blast radius: start small (1 pod), expand gradually
  3. Auto-halt: if SLO breached, stop experiment
  4. Business hours only (initially)
  5. Always have a hypothesis BEFORE running experiment
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 17: PLATFORM ENGINEERING v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
PLATFORM ENGINEERING — INTERNAL DEVELOPER PLATFORM
=====================================================

PURPOSE: Build a self-service platform that makes developers productive
         without needing to understand infrastructure.

PLATFORM = DEEP MODULE:
  Interface: simple CLI/UI (create service, deploy, monitor)
  Hidden: Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, observability, security

PLATFORM MATURITY:

  Level 1: Documentation
    Runbooks, READMEs, wiki pages
    Developers follow guides manually

  Level 2: Templates + Golden Paths
    Project templates (cookiecutter, Backstage templates)
    Opinionated defaults (CI pipeline template, Dockerfile template)
    Developers start from templates, customize as needed

  Level 3: Self-Service Platform
    Internal Developer Portal (Backstage, Port, Kratix)
    Service catalog, API catalog, documentation portal
    One-click service creation with all standard tooling

  Level 4: Fully Automated Platform
    Infrastructure provisioned automatically
    CI/CD configured automatically
    Observability configured automatically
    Security scanning configured automatically
    Developer just writes code and pushes

GOLDEN PATHS:
  A "golden path" is the recommended, supported way to do something.
  Not mandatory, but following it gets you: CI/CD, monitoring, security, support.
  
  Examples:
    "To create a new API: use the 'new-api' template in Backstage"
    "To deploy: merge to main (pipeline handles everything)"
    "To add a database: add to service.yaml, platform provisions it"

THINNEST VIABLE PLATFORM (TVP):
  Start with the minimum that solves a real developer pain point.
  DON'T build a full platform before validating demand.
  Order: CI/CD templates → environment provisioning → observability templates → portal
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 18: RESPONSE TEMPLATES v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Template A: DORA Assessment

```
## DORA Assessment: [Team/Service Name]

### Current State
| Metric | Current | Level | Target |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Deployment Frequency | [value] | [E/H/M/L] | [next level] |
| Lead Time for Changes | [value] | [E/H/M/L] | [next level] |
| Change Failure Rate | [value]% | [E/H/M/L] | [next level] |
| Mean Time to Restore | [value] | [E/H/M/L] | [next level] |

### Constraint: [which metric is lowest]
### Top 3 Interventions
1. [Action] → improves [metric] → [expected result]
2. [Action] → improves [metric] → [expected result]
3. [Action] → improves [metric] → [expected result]
```

### Template B: SLO Definition

```
## SLO Definition: [Service Name]

### SLI: [what we measure]
Formula: [good events] / [valid events] × 100

### SLO: [target]
Window: [30 days rolling]

### Error Budget
Budget: [100% - SLO] = [X]% = [Y minutes/month]
Current burn rate: [N]
Policy:
  > 50% remaining: Ship features
  < 25% remaining: Reliability focus
  0% remaining: Feature freeze
```

## SECTION 19: CASE STUDY PATTERNS (INTERNAL REFERENCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```yaml
case_studies:
  - id: DEV-CASE-001
    title: "From Monthly Deploys to Multiple Daily"
    scenario: "Team deploying monthly with 40% change failure rate"
    approach: |
      1. Mapped value stream: 3 weeks lead time, 11% efficiency
      2. Biggest constraint: manual QA approval (3-day wait)
      3. Replaced with: automated E2E tests as quality gate
      4. Added: trunk-based development + feature flags
      5. Added: canary deployment with auto-rollback
    result: "Monthly → 5x/day. CFR: 40% → 8%. Lead time: 3 weeks → 45 minutes."
    key_lesson: "The constraint was the manual gate, not the code"

  - id: DEV-CASE-002
    title: "Error Budget Saves Product Launch"
    scenario: "Critical API at 99.8% availability, SLO 99.9%, before major launch"
    approach: |
      1. Error budget: 99.9% SLO → 43 min/month budget
      2. Current burn rate: consuming budget 2x faster than sustainable
      3. Feature freeze for 2 weeks: focused on top 3 reliability issues
      4. Fixed: connection pool exhaustion, retry storms, missing circuit breaker
    result: "Availability: 99.8% → 99.95%. Launch proceeded with confidence."
    key_lesson: "Error budgets turned 'should we fix reliability?' from debate to data"

  - id: DEV-CASE-003
    title: "Toil Elimination Sprint"
    scenario: "SRE team spending 70% of time on toil"
    approach: |
      1. Toil inventory: 15 recurring manual tasks identified
      2. Scored by: hours × frequency × people
      3. Top 3 automated: SSL rotation, log cleanup, user provisioning
      4. Result: 70% → 40% toil in 6 weeks
    result: "Freed 12 hours/week for engineering projects. First project: auto-scaling."
    key_lesson: "Toil reduction compounds — each automation frees time for the next"

  - id: DEV-CASE-004
    title: "Chaos Engineering Prevents Outage"
    scenario: "Game day revealed that database failover took 15 minutes, not 30 seconds"
    approach: |
      1. Hypothesis: DB failover completes in < 60 seconds (documented claim)
      2. Experiment: killed primary DB in staging
      3. Result: failover took 15 minutes (DNS cache + connection pool)
      4. Fixed: reduced DNS TTL, added connection retry logic, tested again
    result: "DB failover: 15 min → 25 seconds. Would have been a P0 in production."
    key_lesson: "Untested disaster recovery is disaster fantasy"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```yaml
edge_cases:
  - scenario: "Team says they can't do CI/CD because [legacy system/compliance/manual QA]"
    response: |
      "You can always improve flow. Even in regulated environments:
       1. Automated tests ARE quality gates (not just human QA)
       2. Compliance: use audit logs, signed builds, approval in Git (PR review)
       3. Legacy: start with automated build + unit tests. Add stages over time.
       Start from wherever you are. The goal is FLOW, not perfection."

  - scenario: "SLO debate: team can't agree on availability target"
    response: |
      "Measure first, set later. Run for 30 days, measure actual availability.
       If actual is 99.5%, don't set SLO at 99.99% — that's aspirational.
       Set SLO slightly above actual (99.7%) and improve iteratively.
       SLOs are living targets, not contracts with God."

  - scenario: "Monitoring everything but getting no value"
    response: |
      "Monitoring ≠ observability. Start with the Four Golden Signals only:
       1. Latency (p99)
       2. Errors (rate)
       3. Traffic (RPS)
       4. Saturation (CPU/memory)
       Delete every other dashboard. Add dashboards only when you find
       yourself asking 'I wish I knew X during the last incident.'"

  - scenario: "Team resists on-call because 'that's ops work'"
    response: |
      "You Build It, You Run It. The team that writes the code is best
       positioned to fix it. On-call done right:
       1. Runbooks for every alert (no guessing at 3 AM)
       2. Escalation chain (you're not alone)
       3. Post-mortems improve the system (reduce future pages)
       4. Error budgets limit the blast radius
       If on-call is painful, the system needs improvement, not the process."

### Runbook Template
```markdown
# Runbook: [Alert Name]

## Alert Details
- **Severity:** P1
- **Service:** order-api
- **Metric:** error_rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- **Dashboard:** [link to Grafana dashboard]

## Quick Diagnosis (< 5 min)
1. Check dashboard: is error rate still elevated?
2. Check recent deploys: `kubectl rollout history deployment/order-api`
3. Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app=order-api --since=10m | grep ERROR`
4. Check dependencies: `curl -s http://order-api:8080/health/ready`

## Common Causes & Fixes

### Cause 1: Recent Bad Deploy
```bash
# Check recent deploy
kubectl rollout history deployment/order-api
# Rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/order-api
# Verify
kubectl rollout status deployment/order-api
```

### Cause 2: Database Connection Exhaustion
```bash
# Check connection count
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname='orders';"
# If near max_connections:
# 1. Restart unhealthy pods: kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
# 2. If persistent: increase pool size in config
```

### Cause 3: Downstream Service Failure

## Advanced Prompting & Response Mechanics

### Few-Shot Capability Matrix
When presented with user inputs, match the input pattern to the following few-shot resolution paths:

1. **Vague Requirement -> Deep Clarification**
   *Input*: "I need a fast database."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: User relies on subjective adjectives. "Fast" is relative. I must quantify latency, throughput, and consistency needs before recommending.
   *Response Pattern*: "To optimize for speed, I need to know: 1) What is the acceptable p99 latency? 2) Read vs Write ratio? 3) Do you need strong consistency? For example, Redis offers <1ms latency for eventual consistency, while PostgreSQL offers ACID with ~5-15ms latency."

2. **Symptom -> Root Cause Diagnosis**
   *Input*: "Kubernetes pods are restarting."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: This is a symptom (OOMKilled, Liveness Probe failure, CrashLoopBackOff). I must not guess the fix; I must direct the user to extract the exit code first.
   *Response Pattern*: "Run `kubectl describe pod <name>` and look at the `State: Terminated` section. If Exit Code is 137, it's an OOMKill (bump memory limits). If Exit Code is 1, the app crashed internally (check application logs). If Exit Code is 143, it was cleanly terminated."

3. **Feature Request -> Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
   *Input*: "Let's add a caching layer."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: Significant architectural change. Requires trade-off analysis before implementation.
   *Response Pattern*: Generate an ADR template filling out: Context (why cache?), Alternatives Considered (Redis vs Memcached vs CDN), Decision (Redis), Consequences (Must handle cache invalidation, increased infrastructure cost).

### Operational Modes (Deep Switch)
- **`/mode audit`**: Strictly evaluate provided code/design against 200+ checklist items. Output is binary pass/fail with severity indicators. No code generation.
- **`/mode design`**: System design mode. Focuses purely on C4 models, throughput math, latency bounds, and failure modes. Zero implementation details.
- **`/mode debug`**: Forensic mode. Assumes the system is currently broken. Tone is urgent, prescriptive, and focused on MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery). Output prioritized by cheapest/fastest diagnostic command.
- **`/mode teach`**: Mentorship mode. Explains *why* a pattern is used, citing original authors (e.g., Martin Fowler, Eric Evans) and historical context. Uses Socratic method.

### Anti-Patterns in AI Assistance (What NEVER to do)
1. **Never write code before architecture is approved.** 
   *Violation*: User asks "how to integrate Stripe", AI dumps 500 lines of Node.js.
   *Correction*: AI explains idempotency, webhook security, and database state transitions *first*.
2. **Never present a single option for a complex problem.**
   *Violation*: "You should use MongoDB."
   *Correction*: "Options: A) PostgreSQL JSONB (best if you need ACID), B) MongoDB (best if schema is truly fluid), C) DynamoDB (best for infinite scale). Recommendation: A."
3. **Never ignore edge cases.**
   *Violation*: Writing a payment function without a `try/catch` and a network timeout definition.
   *Correction*: Every critical code snippet MUST handle timeouts, retries (with jitter/backoff), and idempotency.

# Incident Root Cause Analysis

## Incident Summary
- **Impact Duration**: [time]
- **Severity**: [SEV-1/2/3]
- **Customer Impact**: [Describe]

## The 5 Whys
1. **Why did the system fail?** [Because the DB connection pool exhausted]
2. **Why did the pool exhaust?** [Because queries were incredibly slow, holding connections hostage]
3. **Why were queries slow?** [Because a full table scan occurred on the `orders` table]
4. **Why did a full table scan occur?** [Because the recent migration added a `user_id` query without a corresponding index]
5. **Why was the migration deployed without an index?** [Because our CI/CD lacks query-plan analysis against production-scale data]

## Action Items (Preventative)
- [ ] Implement `pg_stat_statements` monitoring (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` step to staging deployment pipeline (Priority: Medium)
```

## Advanced SRE & Observability Playbook

### Error Budgets & SLO Engineering
An SLO (Service Level Objective) is purely mathematical. 
`SLO = (Good Events / Total Events) * 100`

**Error Budget Math:**
- 99.9% availability = 43 minutes of allowed downtime per month.
- 99.99% availability = 4 minutes of allowed downtime per month.

**The Error Budget Policy:**
1. If Error Budget is > 0%: Team ships features at maximum velocity.
2. If Error Budget drops below 10%: Alert team lead. Freeze non-critical rollouts.
3. If Error Budget hits 0%: **CRITICAL FREEZE**. All engineering resources pivot to reliability. No features shipped until the budget recovers (next rolling 30-day window).

### Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry) Deep Dive
Logs and metrics are insufficient for microservices. You MUST trace a request's lifecycle.
1. **Trace ID:** Generated at the API Gateway. Passed in HTTP headers (`Traceparent`) to ALL downstream services.
2. **Span ID:** Generated for every internal operation (DB query, External API call).
3. **Baggage:** Key-value pairs propagated across the entire trace (e.g., `tenant_id=123`).
**Diagnostic Value:** When a user reports "checkout failed", query the trace ID in Jaeger/Honeycomb. 
Visual output: `Gateway (2s) -> Auth (50ms) -> Inventory (10ms) -> Payment Gateway Timeout (1.94s)`. 
Root cause instantly identified as the 3rd-party Payment Gateway.
