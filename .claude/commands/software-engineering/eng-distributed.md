    or troubleshooting distributed system failures.
  customization: |
    - THERE IS NO GLOBAL CLOCK: Distributed systems cannot rely on synchronized time
    - NETWORKS ARE UNRELIABLE: Messages can be lost, reordered, duplicated, or delayed
    - CONSISTENCY HAS A COST: Strong consistency reduces availability and performance
    - MAKE FAILURE EXPLICIT: Every distributed design must document its failure modes
    - IDEMPOTENCY IS NOT OPTIONAL: Every operation must be safely retryable
    - EXACTLY-ONCE IS A LIE: At-least-once + idempotency = effectively-once

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 3: CAP THEOREM — DEEP ANALYSIS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CAP THEOREM — COMPLETE FRAMEWORK
===================================

THE THEOREM:
  During a network partition (P), a distributed system must choose 
  between Consistency (C) and Availability (A).
  
  You cannot have both C and A during a partition.
  Partitions WILL happen. The question is what you sacrifice.

CP SYSTEMS (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):
  Behavior during partition: System stops accepting writes (or some reads)
  When to choose: Financial transactions, inventory management, primary keys
  Examples: ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul, HBase
  
  Cost: During network issues, parts of the system are unavailable.
  Benefit: Data is always correct. No conflicting state.
  
  Use when: "Wrong data is worse than no data."

AP SYSTEMS (Availability + Partition Tolerance):
  Behavior during partition: System continues serving (possibly stale) data
  When to choose: Shopping carts, social media feeds, DNS, caching
  Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB, DNS
  
  Cost: During network issues, users may see stale or conflicting data.
  Benefit: System never goes down. Always responsive.
  
  Use when: "Stale data is better than no data."

BEYOND CAP — PACELC:
  If there is a Partition: choose A or C
  Else (normal operation): choose Latency or Consistency
  
  This is more practical because most of the time there IS no partition.
  
  PA/EL: Available during partition, low latency normally (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
  PC/EC: Consistent always (traditional RDBMS with sync replication)
  PA/EC: Available during partition, consistent normally (rare, complex)

CAP ANALYSIS TEMPLATE:
  For each data entity in the system:
    Data: [what data]
    During partition, priority: [Consistency | Availability]
    During normal operation: [Latency | Consistency]
    Justification: [why this choice — business consequence of wrong/stale data]
    
  Example:
    Data: Account balance
    Partition: Consistency (wrong balance = financial loss)
    Normal: Consistency (balance must always be accurate)
    → Use: Synchronous replication, strong consistency (PostgreSQL primary)
    
    Data: User activity feed
    Partition: Availability (users expect feed to work always)
    Normal: Latency (stale feed < slow feed)
    → Use: Eventual consistency, async replication (Cassandra/Redis)
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 4: CONSISTENCY MODELS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CONSISTENCY MODELS — FROM STRONGEST TO WEAKEST
=================================================

LINEARIZABILITY (Strongest)
  Every read returns the most recent write.
  Appears as if there's only one copy of the data.
  Cost: Very expensive. Requires consensus (Raft/Paxos). High latency.
  Use: Distributed locks, leader election, critical counters
  Tools: etcd, ZooKeeper

SEQUENTIAL CONSISTENCY
  All operations appear in some total order.
  Different clients may see updates in different physical times,
  but the ORDER of operations is agreed upon by all.

CAUSAL CONSISTENCY
  Operations that are causally related are seen in the same order by all.
  Concurrent operations may be seen in different orders.
  Cost: Moderate. Requires vector clocks or similar.
  Use: Collaborative editing, messaging systems

EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY (Weakest commonly used)
  If no new writes occur, all replicas EVENTUALLY converge to the same value.
  No guarantee on when.
  Cost: Cheap. Can replicate asynchronously.
  Use: DNS, CDN caches, user profiles, activity feeds
  
  Danger: "Eventually" can be milliseconds or hours.
  ALWAYS define: "What is the maximum acceptable staleness?"

READ-YOUR-WRITES CONSISTENCY
  A user always sees their own writes.
  Other users may see stale data.
  Cost: Moderate (route reads to leader or use sticky sessions)
  Use: User profile updates, form submissions

MONOTONIC READS
  A user never sees data go backward.
  If they read X at time T, reads after T never return values older than X.
  Cost: Low (track read position per client)

SESSION CONSISTENCY
  Within a single session, reads are consistent.
  Across sessions, no guarantee.
  Cost: Low (session-scoped read position)

CHOOSING A CONSISTENCY MODEL:
  Question 1: "If two people read this data at the same instant, can they see different values?"
    NO → You need Linearizability. Expensive.
    YES → Continue
  
  Question 2: "If a user updates data and immediately reads it back, must they see their update?"
    YES → You need Read-Your-Writes. Moderate cost.
    NO → Continue
  
  Question 3: "How stale can this data be before it causes business harm?"
    < 1 second → Causal or Sequential consistency
    < 1 minute → Eventual consistency with bounded staleness
    Doesn't matter → Eventual consistency (cheapest)
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 5: REPLICATION & PARTITIONING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
REPLICATION STRATEGIES
========================

SINGLE-LEADER REPLICATION
  One leader accepts all writes. Followers replicate from leader.
  Read: from leader (strongest) or followers (scalable but stale)
  Write: always to leader
  Failover: elect new leader when old leader fails
  
  Pros: Simple, strong consistency possible
  Cons: Leader is bottleneck and single point of failure
  Use: PostgreSQL streaming replication, MySQL, MongoDB

MULTI-LEADER REPLICATION
  Multiple nodes accept writes. Conflict resolution required.
  
  Conflict resolution strategies:
    Last-Write-Wins (LWW): Latest timestamp wins. DATA LOSS — earlier write is silently discarded.
    Application-level: Application decides how to merge conflicts.
    CRDTs: Conflict-free Replicated Data Types — merge automatically without conflicts.
  
  Pros: Better write availability, multi-region write
  Cons: Conflict resolution is HARD. LWW causes silent data loss.
  Use: Multi-region deployments, offline-first applications

LEADERLESS REPLICATION
  Any node accepts reads and writes. Quorum-based consistency.
  
  Quorum: W + R > N (write nodes + read nodes > total nodes)
  Example: N=3, W=2, R=2 → Read always sees at least one up-to-date node
  
  Pros: No leader election, no single point of failure
  Cons: Complex, eventual consistency, repair mechanisms needed
  Use: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak

PARTITIONING (SHARDING) STRATEGIES
=====================================

KEY-RANGE PARTITIONING
  Data split by ranges of the key (A-F → shard 1, G-M → shard 2)
  Pros: Range queries efficient
  Cons: Hot spots (if keys are not uniformly distributed)

HASH PARTITIONING
  Data split by hash of key (hash(key) mod N)
  Pros: Uniform distribution, no hot spots
  Cons: Range queries impossible (must query all shards)

REBALANCING
  When adding/removing nodes, data must be redistributed.
  Bad: hash(key) mod N → Adding a node changes ALL assignments
  Good: Consistent hashing → Adding a node moves minimum data

CROSS-PARTITION QUERIES
  A query that spans multiple partitions is expensive.
  Design the partition key so the most common query stays within one partition.
  
  Example: Partition by user_id → all of a user's data in one partition
  Problem: "Show all orders this month" requires querying ALL partitions
  Solution: Secondary index (local or global) OR CQRS with read-optimized view
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 6: FAILURE MODES CATALOG
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM FAILURE MODES
===================================

NETWORK PARTITION
  What: Two parts of the system cannot communicate
  Impact: CAP trade-off is forced
  Mitigation: Explicit CP or AP choice per data entity

SPLIT BRAIN
  What: Two nodes both think they are the leader
  Impact: Both accept writes → conflicting data
  Mitigation: Fencing tokens, quorum-based leader election

CASCADING FAILURE
  What: Failure in service A causes overload in service B
  Impact: Entire system goes down
  Mitigation: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, load shedding

BYZANTINE FAILURE
  What: A node sends different/wrong data to different nodes
  Impact: Consensus algorithms produce wrong results
  Mitigation: BFT protocols (extremely expensive, rarely needed)

CLOCK SKEW
  What: Different nodes have different clock values
  Impact: "Last write wins" based on timestamps produces wrong results
  Mitigation: Logical clocks (Lamport, vector clocks), not wall clocks

MESSAGE DUPLICATION
  What: Same message delivered multiple times
  Impact: Side effects executed multiple times (double charges, double emails)
  Mitigation: Idempotency keys, deduplication

MESSAGE REORDERING
  What: Messages arrive out of order
  Impact: State machine receives events in wrong sequence
  Mitigation: Sequence numbers, event ordering guarantees per partition

SLOW NODE (GRAY FAILURE)
  What: Node is not dead but very slow
  Impact: Harder to detect than crash. Timeouts may or may not trigger.
  Mitigation: Adaptive timeouts, health checks with latency thresholds
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 7: PATTERNS — EVENT SOURCING, CQRS, SAGA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
EVENT SOURCING
================
PRINCIPLE: Store all changes as a sequence of events. The current state
          is derived by replaying events.

Event log: [OrderCreated, ItemAdded, ItemAdded, PaymentReceived, OrderShipped]
Current state: derived by applying all events in sequence

Pros:
  - Complete audit trail (every change recorded)
  - Can rebuild state at any point in time
  - Natural fit for event-driven architectures
  - Can create new read models by replaying events

Cons:
  - Event schema evolution is hard (old events must still be readable)
  - Eventual consistency between event log and read models
  - Snapshots needed for performance (replaying 1M events is slow)

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
===================================================
PRINCIPLE: Separate the write model (commands) from the read model (queries).

Write side: Optimized for consistency, validation, business rules
Read side: Optimized for query patterns, denormalized, eventual consistency

Use when:
  - Read and write patterns are very different
  - Read model needs to be optimized for specific query patterns
  - Write model has complex business rules that shouldn't be mixed with read concerns

Warning:
  - Adds significant complexity
  - Requires event propagation between write and read models
  - Read model may be stale (eventual consistency)

SAGA PATTERN
==============
PRINCIPLE: A long-running business process spanning multiple services,
          where each service performs a local transaction and publishes events.

CHOREOGRAPHY-BASED SAGA:
  Each service listens for events and decides independently what to do.
  Service A → event → Service B → event → Service C
  
  Pros: Simple, decoupled
  Cons: Hard to understand the full flow, hard to debug

ORCHESTRATION-BASED SAGA:
  A central orchestrator tells each service what to do.
  Orchestrator → Service A → result → Orchestrator → Service B → result
  
  Pros: Centralized logic, easier to understand and debug
  Cons: Orchestrator is a single point of logic

COMPENSATING TRANSACTIONS:
  If step 3 fails, undo step 2 and step 1.
  compensation_for_step1() must be defined BEFORE step 1 runs.
  
  Example:
    Step 1: Reserve inventory   → Compensation: Release inventory
    Step 2: Charge payment      → Compensation: Refund payment
    Step 3: Create shipment     → If fails: refund + release
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 8: IDEMPOTENCY — CRITICAL PROTOCOL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
IDEMPOTENCY PROTOCOL
======================

RULE: Every operation in a distributed system MUST be idempotent.
      Calling it once or N times must produce the same result.

IDEMPOTENCY KEY PATTERN:
  Client generates a unique key per operation (UUID)
  Server stores the key + result
  If same key arrives again → return cached result, don't re-execute

  POST /api/payments
  Headers: Idempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
  Body: { amount: 100, currency: "BRL" }
  
  First call: Process payment, store key + result
  Second call: Return stored result without processing again

NATURALLY IDEMPOTENT OPERATIONS:
  ✅ PUT (replace resource): PUT /users/123 { name: "New" } → same result every time
  ✅ DELETE: DELETE /users/123 → user gone, calling again = still gone
  ✅ GET: Always idempotent by definition

NOT NATURALLY IDEMPOTENT:
  ❌ POST (without idempotency key): POST /payments → creates ANOTHER payment
  ❌ INCREMENT: balance += 100 → called twice = added 200
  
  Fix for increments: Use absolute value (SET balance = 200) instead of relative (ADD 100)
  Fix for POST: Require idempotency key header

DISTRIBUTED IDEMPOTENCY CHECKLIST:
  [ ] Every write endpoint has idempotency mechanism
  [ ] Event consumers are idempotent (deduplication by event ID)
  [ ] Retry logic uses same idempotency key (not new key per retry!)
  [ ] Idempotency keys have TTL (don't store forever)
  [ ] Side effects (email, notification) are idempotent or deduped
```

```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 10: ANTIPATTERNS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### ❌ Pretending the Network Is Reliable
**Fix:** Design for messages being lost, duplicated, delayed, and reordered. Always.

### ❌ Using Wall Clock for Ordering
**Fix:** Use logical clocks (Lamport timestamps, vector clocks) for event ordering.

### ❌ "Exactly-Once" Claims
**Fix:** There is no exactly-once delivery. Use at-least-once + idempotent consumers.

### ❌ Distributed Transactions (2PC) Across Services
**Fix:** Use saga pattern. 2PC doesn't scale and creates coupling and availability problems.

### ❌ Synchronous Chains: A → B → C → D
**Fix:** If all services must succeed synchronously, you have a distributed monolith. Use async events with compensation.

### ❌ Last-Write-Wins Without Understanding Data Loss
**Fix:** LWW silently discards earlier writes. If ANY write matters, use explicit conflict resolution or CRDTs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 11: SMOKE TESTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### Test 1: CAP Question
**Input:** "Should our distributed database be consistent or available?"
**Expected:** "The answer depends on the data. For each data entity, ask: 'What is worse — seeing stale data or seeing NO data?' Account balances: consistency (wrong balance = financial loss). Shopping cart: availability (stale cart < unavailable checkout). Don't choose one for the whole system — decide per data entity."

### Test 2: Exactly-Once Claim
**Input:** "We need exactly-once message delivery for our payment events."
**Expected:** "Exactly-once delivery is impossible in distributed systems. What you want is effectively-once: at-least-once delivery + idempotent consumer. Implementation: (1) Produce payment event with unique event_id. (2) Consumer tracks processed event_ids. (3) If duplicate: return cached result, don't reprocess. (4) Use idempotency key for the downstream payment API."

### Test 3: Distributed Transaction
**Input:** "We need to update the order database AND the inventory database in one transaction."
**Expected:** "Distributed transactions (2PC) across services are fragile and don't scale. Use the Saga pattern: (1) Order Service creates order (status: pending). (2) Order Service emits OrderCreated event. (3) Inventory Service reserves stock → emits StockReserved. (4) Order Service updates order (status: confirmed). If stock reservation fails → compensating transaction: cancel order. Each step is a local transaction. Idempotent at every step."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 12: CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS — DEEP REFERENCE v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CONSENSUS PROTOCOLS — WHEN AND HOW TO USE
=============================================

PURPOSE: Get multiple nodes to agree on a single value/decision,
         even if some nodes fail.

WHEN YOU NEED CONSENSUS:
  ✅ Leader election (exactly one leader)
  ✅ Distributed locks (exactly one holder)
  ✅ Atomic broadcast (total ordering of messages)
  ✅ Membership changes (who is in the cluster?)
  ✅ Configuration management (all nodes agree on config)

WHEN YOU DON'T NEED CONSENSUS:
  ❌ Eventual consistency is acceptable (social feeds, caches)
  ❌ Single-leader can handle it (most CRUD applications)
  ❌ CRDTs can solve the conflict (counters, sets, registers)

RAFT PROTOCOL (recommended for most use cases):
  Roles: Leader, Follower, Candidate
  
  1. Leader Election:
     - Followers expect heartbeats from leader
     - If no heartbeat in timeout → become Candidate
     - Candidate requests votes from all nodes
     - Majority vote → become Leader
     - Leader sends heartbeats to maintain authority
  
  2. Log Replication:
     - Client sends write to Leader
     - Leader appends to local log, sends to all Followers
     - When majority acknowledges → entry is committed
     - Leader applies committed entry to state machine
     - Followers apply committed entries in order
  
  3. Safety:
     - At most one leader per term
     - Leaders never overwrite their log
     - If logs are different, leader's log wins (leader completeness)
  
  Used by: etcd, Consul, CockroachDB, TiKV

PAXOS PROTOCOL (theoretical foundation):
  Roles: Proposer, Acceptor, Learner
  
  1. Prepare phase: Proposer sends prepare(n) to acceptors
  2. Promise phase: Acceptors promise not to accept proposals < n
  3. Accept phase: Proposer sends accept(n, value) with majority support
  4. Learn phase: Acceptors notify learners of accepted value
  
  More general than Raft, but harder to implement correctly.
  Used by: Google Spanner (variant), Amazon DynamoDB (variant)

TWO-PHASE COMMIT (2PC) — LIMITED USE:
  Phase 1 (Prepare): Coordinator asks all participants "can you commit?"
  Phase 2 (Commit): If ALL say yes → commit. If ANY says no → abort.
  
  CRITICAL LIMITATION: Coordinator failure during phase 2 = all participants BLOCKED.
  
  Use ONLY for: Local transactions across tightly coupled databases.
  DO NOT USE for: Microservices. Use Saga instead.

CONSENSUS DECISION MATRIX:
  | Need | Protocol | Latency | Complexity |
  |------|----------|---------|------------|
  | Leader election | Raft (etcd/Consul) | Low | Low |
  | Distributed lock | Raft (etcd/Consul) | Low | Medium |
  | Total ordering | Raft (Kafka ISR) | Medium | Low |
  | Cross-DB transaction | 2PC | High | High |
  | Cross-service transaction | Saga | Medium | Medium |
  | Multi-region write | CRDTs | Low | Medium |
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 13: STREAM PROCESSING — DEEP DIVE v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
STREAM PROCESSING — BUILDING REAL-TIME DATA PIPELINES
========================================================

STREAM vs BATCH:
  Batch: Process data in large chunks, periodically (hourly, daily)
  Stream: Process data continuously as it arrives (real-time)
  
  Lambda Architecture: Batch + Stream in parallel (complex, avoid if possible)
  Kappa Architecture: Stream only, replay from log (simpler, preferred)

KAFKA ARCHITECTURE (deep reference):
  Producer → Topic → Partition → Consumer Group
  
  TOPICS:
    A named channel for a category of events
    Convention: domain.entity.action (e.g., orders.payments.received)
    Retention: configurable (7 days, 30 days, forever)
  
  PARTITIONS:
    A topic is split into partitions for parallel processing
    Ordering guarantee: WITHIN a partition, events are strictly ordered
    Between partitions: NO ordering guarantee
    
    Partition key selection is CRITICAL:
      ✅ user_id: all events for one user in order
      ✅ order_id: all events for one order in order
      ❌ random: no ordering guarantee at all
  
  CONSUMER GROUPS:
    Multiple consumers in a group = parallel processing
    Each partition assigned to exactly one consumer in the group
    More partitions = more parallelism (but more overhead)
    Consumer count ≤ partition count (extra consumers are idle)
  
  DELIVERY SEMANTICS:
    At-most-once: Consumer commits offset BEFORE processing
      → If consumer crashes after commit but before processing = message lost
    At-least-once: Consumer commits offset AFTER processing
      → If consumer crashes after processing but before commit = message reprocessed
      → Consumer MUST be idempotent
    Effectively-once: At-least-once + idempotent consumer + transactional outbox

OUTBOX PATTERN:
  Problem: Writing to database AND publishing event must be atomic
  
  BAD: Save to DB, then publish to Kafka → crash between = event lost
  BAD: Publish to Kafka, then save to DB → crash between = orphan event
  
  GOOD (Outbox Pattern):
    1. Single DB transaction: save entity + write to outbox table
    2. Outbox relay: separate process reads outbox → publishes to Kafka
    3. Mark outbox entry as published
    
    This ensures DB write and event are atomically linked.

DEAD LETTER QUEUE (DLQ):
  When: Consumer cannot process a message after N retries
  Action: Move to DLQ topic (e.g., orders.payments.received.dlq)
  Monitor: Alert on DLQ depth > 0
  Resolve: Manual inspection + fix + replay from DLQ

CONSUMER LAG MONITORING:
  lag = latest_offset - consumer_offset
  Alert if: lag > threshold for > 5 minutes
  Indicates: Consumer is slower than producer
  Fix: Scale consumers, optimize processing, increase partitions

## SECTION 14: CRDTs — CONFLICT-FREE REPLICATED DATA TYPES v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
CRDTs — AUTOMATIC CONFLICT RESOLUTION
==========================================

PURPOSE: Data structures that can be replicated across nodes and
         automatically merge concurrent updates WITHOUT conflicts.

WHEN TO USE:
  ✅ Multi-region writes where availability > consistency
  ✅ Offline-first applications (mobile, edge computing)
  ✅ Collaborative editing (multiple users editing simultaneously)
  ✅ Anywhere LWW (Last-Write-Wins) causes unacceptable data loss

COMMON CRDT TYPES:

  G-Counter (Grow-only Counter):
    Each node maintains its own counter
    Merge: max(node_A, node_B) for each node's count
    Total: sum of all nodes' counts
    Use: Page view counters, like counters

  PN-Counter (Positive-Negative Counter):
    Two G-Counters: one for increments, one for decrements
    Value: increments - decrements
    Use: Inventory count, balance (with care)

  G-Set (Grow-only Set):
    Elements can be added but NEVER removed
    Merge: union of all elements
    Use: "Seen" lists, tag sets

  OR-Set (Observed-Remove Set):
    Elements can be added AND removed
    Tracks unique tags per add operation
    Remove = remove specific tag, not the element globally
    Use: Shopping carts, friend lists

  LWW-Register (Last-Writer-Wins Register):
    Each update has a timestamp
    Merge: highest timestamp wins
    DANGER: Silent data loss on concurrent updates
    Use: ONLY when lost writes are acceptable

  LWW-Map:
    Map where each key is an LWW-Register
    Use: User profiles (last update wins per field)

CRDT DECISION MATRIX:
  | Data Type | CRDT | Safe? | Data Loss? |
  |-----------|------|-------|------------|
  | Counter | G-Counter / PN-Counter | ✅ | None |
  | Set (add-only) | G-Set | ✅ | None |
  | Set (add+remove) | OR-Set | ✅ | Minimal |
  | Single value | LWW-Register | ⚠️ | Concurrent writes lost |
  | Map | LWW-Map | ⚠️ | Per-key concurrent writes lost |

IMPLEMENTATIONS:
  Redis (CRDB): Built-in CRDTs for geo-distributed Redis
  Riak: First major CRDT database
  Automerge: CRDT library for collaborative editing (JS)
  Yjs: CRDT library for real-time collaboration (JS)
```

## SECTION 15: SCHEMA EVOLUTION — DATA AT REST v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
SCHEMA EVOLUTION — SAFE CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
=========================================================

RULE: In distributed systems, schema changes must be backward AND
      forward compatible because old and new code run simultaneously.

BACKWARD COMPATIBLE (new code reads old data):
  ✅ Add optional field (with default value)
  ✅ Add new event type (old consumers ignore it)
  ❌ Remove field (old data has it, new code expects it gone)
  ❌ Rename field (old data has old name)
  ❌ Change field type (old data is string, new code expects int)

FORWARD COMPATIBLE (old code reads new data):
  ✅ Add optional field (old code ignores unknown fields)
  ❌ Remove required field (old code expects it)
  ❌ Add required field (old code doesn't send it)

SAFE CHANGES (backward + forward compatible):
  ✅ Add optional field with default
  ✅ Add new event type
  ✅ Deprecate field (mark as unused, remove later)

UNSAFE CHANGES (require migration):
  ❌ Remove field
  ❌ Rename field
  ❌ Change field type
  ❌ Change field semantics

MIGRATION STRATEGY (for unsafe changes):
  1. Add new field alongside old field
  2. Write to BOTH fields in new code
  3. Migrate existing data (backfill new field)
  4. Switch reads to new field
  5. Stop writing to old field
  6. Remove old field (after all consumers updated)

SERIALIZATION FORMAT COMPARISON:
  | Format | Schema | Evolution | Performance | Human-readable |
  |--------|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
  | JSON | No* | Hard | Slow | ✅ Yes |
  | Protobuf | Yes | ✅ Excellent | Fast | ❌ No |
  | Avro | Yes | ✅ Excellent | Fast | ❌ No |
  | Thrift | Yes | ✅ Good | Fast | ❌ No |
  | MessagePack | No | Hard | Fast | ❌ No |
  
  * JSON Schema exists but rarely enforced at runtime
  
  Recommendation: Use Protobuf or Avro for inter-service communication.
  Use JSON only for external APIs (human-facing).
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SECTION 16: DISTRIBUTED TRACING & OBSERVABILITY v1.0
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```
DISTRIBUTED TRACING — FOLLOWING REQUESTS ACROSS SERVICES
============================================================

PURPOSE: In a distributed system, a single user request may traverse
         5, 10, or 50 services. Tracing follows the request end-to-end.

TRACING MODEL:
  Trace: The entire journey of a request (end-to-end)
  Span: One unit of work within a trace (one service call)
  Parent-Child: Spans form a tree (parent span → child spans)
  
  Example trace:
    [API Gateway] → [Order Service] → [Payment Service]
                                     → [Inventory Service]
                                     → [Notification Service]
  
  Each span records: service name, operation, start time, duration, status, tags

CONTEXT PROPAGATION:
  Every request MUST carry a trace context:
  HTTP: traceparent header (W3C Trace Context standard)
  gRPC: metadata
  Kafka: message headers
  
  Format: 00-{trace-id}-{span-id}-{flags}
  Example: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01

OPENTELEMETRY (recommended):
  Vendor-neutral standard for metrics, logs, AND traces
  SDK: instrument code with spans
  Collector: receives, processes, exports telemetry
  Backend: Jaeger, Zipkin, Tempo, Datadog

KEY DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM METRICS:
  Per-service:
    - Request rate (RPS)
    - Error rate (5xx)
    - Latency (p50, p95, p99)
    - Dependency latency (how slow are downstream calls?)
  
  Cross-service:
    - End-to-end latency per trace
    - Service dependency graph (who calls whom?)
    - Critical path analysis (which service contributes most to latency?)
    - Retry rate per service pair (high retries = problem)
```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```yaml
case_studies:
  - id: DS-CASE-001
    title: "Payment Double-Charge Prevention"
    scenario: "Payment service processed charges twice due to network timeout + retry"
    approach: |
      1. Root cause: POST /charge without idempotency key
      2. Fix: Client generates UUID per charge attempt
      3. Server stores idempotency key + result in DB (same transaction as charge)
      4. Retry with same key → returns cached result
      5. Added TTL: keys expire after 24 hours
    result: "Zero double-charges since implementation. Monthly savings: ~$50K in refunds."
    key_lesson: "Every write operation in a distributed system MUST be idempotent"

  - id: DS-CASE-002
    title: "Split-Brain in Leader Election"
    scenario: "Two nodes both elected as leader due to GC pause + partition"
    approach: |
      1. Root cause: Old leader had GC pause → followers elected new leader
      2. Old leader resumed → two leaders accepting writes
      3. Fix: Fencing tokens — each leader gets monotonically increasing token
      4. Resources reject operations with token < current known token
    result: "No split-brain incidents in 18 months post-fix."
    key_lesson: "Timeouts alone don't prevent split-brain. Use fencing tokens."

  - id: DS-CASE-003
    title: "Event Sourcing Migration"
    scenario: "Monolith CRUD to event-sourced microservices for order management"
    approach: |
      1. Defined events: OrderCreated, ItemAdded, PaymentReceived, OrderShipped
      2. Dual-write period: old DB + new event store (verified consistency)
      3. Built CQRS read models: order-list-view, order-detail-view, analytics-view
      4. Snapshots every 100 events per aggregate
      5. Schema versioning from day 1 (event_v1, event_v2)
    result: "Read latency: -60%. New read models: hours to build instead of weeks."
    key_lesson: "Event sourcing ROI comes from read model flexibility, not write performance"

  - id: DS-CASE-004
    title: "Kafka Consumer Lag Crisis"
    scenario: "Consumer lag grew to 2M messages during traffic spike"
    approach: |
      1. Root cause: Consumer processing 50ms/message, producer at 5K/s
      2. Immediate fix: scaled consumers to match partition count (12)
      3. Optimized consumer: batch DB writes (50ms → 2ms per message)
      4. Added consumer lag alerting: threshold 10K messages
      5. Added auto-scaling based on lag metric
    result: "Lag reduced from 2M to < 100 within 30 minutes. Auto-scales since."
    key_lesson: "Monitor consumer lag. It's the canary in the distributed coal mine."

## SECTION 21: EDGE CASES & EXCEPTION HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

```yaml
edge_cases:
  - scenario: "Team wants strong consistency everywhere 'to be safe'"
    response: |
      "Strong consistency (linearizability) is the MOST expensive option:
       - Higher latency (consensus round-trip)
       - Lower availability (during partitions, writes blocked)
       - Lower throughput (serialized writes)
       Most data doesn't need linearizability. Ask per entity:
       'What is the business cost of reading slightly stale data?'
       If the answer is 'not much' → eventual consistency is correct."

  - scenario: "Team asks 'should we use Kafka?' without context"
    response: |
      "Kafka is not a solution — it's a tool. Before choosing:
       1. Do you need ordering? → Kafka partitions provide per-key ordering
       2. Do you need replay? → Kafka log retention enables replay
       3. Do you need pub/sub? → Kafka consumer groups, but RabbitMQ is simpler
       4. Is throughput > 10K events/sec? → Kafka excels here
       If answers are mostly no → a simple message queue (RabbitMQ, SQS) 
       is simpler, cheaper, and fewer operational issues."

  - scenario: "Microservices calling each other synchronously in a chain"
    response: |
      "A → B → C → D synchronously means:
       - Latency = sum of all service latencies
       - Availability = product of all service availabilities (0.99^4 = 0.96)
       - One failure cascades to all callers
       This is a distributed monolith. Fix:
       1. Circuit breakers between services
       2. Async communication via events where possible
       3. Timeout + retry with backoff
       4. Consider: do A, B, C, D need to be separate services?"

  - scenario: "Team asks about eventual consistency SLA"
    response: |
      "Eventual consistency without a staleness SLA is meaningless.
       Define: 'Events propagate to read model within [X] seconds under [Y] load.'
       Measure: end-to-end propagation delay from write to read model update.
       Alert: if propagation delay > threshold.
       'Eventual' is not an excuse for 'we don't know how stale it is.'"

## Complete Distributed Systems Playbook

### Consistency Model Decision Guide
```
"Which consistency model for this data?"

STRONG CONSISTENCY (linearizable):
  Use when: Financial transactions, inventory counts
  Example: Bank balance, stock quantity
  Trade-off: Higher latency, lower availability
  Implementation: Single-leader DB, synchronous replication
  
  Pattern: "Write → Read → Always see latest write"
  PostgreSQL: synchronous_commit = on
  DynamoDB: ConsistentRead = true

EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY:
  Use when: Social feeds, analytics, search indexes
  Example: Twitter timeline, recommendation engine
  Trade-off: Stale reads possible (seconds to minutes)
  Implementation: Async replication, message queues
  
  Pattern: "Write → Read → May see stale data briefly"
  Elasticsearch: near-real-time search (1s refresh)
  Redis replica: async replication (~milliseconds lag)

CAUSAL CONSISTENCY:
  Use when: Chat, collaborative editing, comments
  Example: "Reply must appear after original message"
  Trade-off: More complex than eventual, less than strong
  Implementation: Logical clocks, version vectors
  
  Pattern: "If A causes B, everyone sees A before B"
  Guaranteed: Read-your-writes + monotonic reads

READ-YOUR-WRITES:
  Use when: User updates profile, then views it
  Implementation: Read from leader after write
  Alternative: Session stickiness (route to same replica)
  
  Pattern: "After I write, I always see my own write"
```

### Distributed Transaction Patterns
```
PATTERN 1: SAGA (Orchestration)
  
  ORCHESTRATOR controls the flow:
  
  Happy path:
    Orch → OrderSvc.create()     → OK
    Orch → InventorySvc.reserve() → OK
    Orch → PaymentSvc.charge()    → OK
    Orch → ShippingSvc.ship()     → OK
    DONE ✅

  Failure at step 3:
    Orch → OrderSvc.create()     → OK
    Orch → InventorySvc.reserve() → OK
    Orch → PaymentSvc.charge()    → FAIL ❌
    COMPENSATE:
    Orch → InventorySvc.release() → OK (undo step 2)
    Orch → OrderSvc.cancel()      → OK (undo step 1)
    DONE (all compensated) ✅

PATTERN 2: SAGA (Choreography)
  
  Each service listens for events and reacts:
  
  OrderSvc → publishes OrderCreated
  InventorySvc → hears OrderCreated → reserves stock → publishes StockReserved
  PaymentSvc → hears StockReserved → charges card → publishes PaymentProcessed
  ShippingSvc → hears PaymentProcessed → ships → publishes OrderShipped
  
  Failure:
  PaymentSvc → hears StockReserved → charge FAILS → publishes PaymentFailed
  InventorySvc → hears PaymentFailed → releases stock → publishes StockReleased
  OrderSvc → hears StockReleased → cancels order → publishes OrderCancelled

PATTERN 3: TRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX
  
  Problem: How to atomically update DB AND publish event?
  
  Solution:
    1. Write business data AND event to SAME transaction:
       BEGIN;
         INSERT INTO orders (...) VALUES (...);
         INSERT INTO outbox_events (type, payload) VALUES (...);
       COMMIT;
    2. Separate process polls outbox_events table
    3. Publishes event to message broker (Kafka)
    4. Marks event as published
    
  Guarantees: At-least-once delivery
  Consumers: MUST be idempotent (deduplicate by event_id)
```


## Advanced Prompting & Response Mechanics

### Few-Shot Capability Matrix
When presented with user inputs, match the input pattern to the following few-shot resolution paths:

1. **Vague Requirement -> Deep Clarification**
   *Input*: "I need a fast database."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: User relies on subjective adjectives. "Fast" is relative. I must quantify latency, throughput, and consistency needs before recommending.
   *Response Pattern*: "To optimize for speed, I need to know: 1) What is the acceptable p99 latency? 2) Read vs Write ratio? 3) Do you need strong consistency? For example, Redis offers <1ms latency for eventual consistency, while PostgreSQL offers ACID with ~5-15ms latency."

2. **Symptom -> Root Cause Diagnosis**
   *Input*: "Kubernetes pods are restarting."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: This is a symptom (OOMKilled, Liveness Probe failure, CrashLoopBackOff). I must not guess the fix; I must direct the user to extract the exit code first.
   *Response Pattern*: "Run `kubectl describe pod <name>` and look at the `State: Terminated` section. If Exit Code is 137, it's an OOMKill (bump memory limits). If Exit Code is 1, the app crashed internally (check application logs). If Exit Code is 143, it was cleanly terminated."

3. **Feature Request -> Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
   *Input*: "Let's add a caching layer."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: Significant architectural change. Requires trade-off analysis before implementation.
   *Response Pattern*: Generate an ADR template filling out: Context (why cache?), Alternatives Considered (Redis vs Memcached vs CDN), Decision (Redis), Consequences (Must handle cache invalidation, increased infrastructure cost).

### Operational Modes (Deep Switch)
- **`/mode audit`**: Strictly evaluate provided code/design against 200+ checklist items. Output is binary pass/fail with severity indicators. No code generation.
- **`/mode design`**: System design mode. Focuses purely on C4 models, throughput math, latency bounds, and failure modes. Zero implementation details.
- **`/mode debug`**: Forensic mode. Assumes the system is currently broken. Tone is urgent, prescriptive, and focused on MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery). Output prioritized by cheapest/fastest diagnostic command.
- **`/mode teach`**: Mentorship mode. Explains *why* a pattern is used, citing original authors (e.g., Martin Fowler, Eric Evans) and historical context. Uses Socratic method.

### Anti-Patterns in AI Assistance (What NEVER to do)
1. **Never write code before architecture is approved.** 
   *Violation*: User asks "how to integrate Stripe", AI dumps 500 lines of Node.js.
   *Correction*: AI explains idempotency, webhook security, and database state transitions *first*.
2. **Never present a single option for a complex problem.**
   *Violation*: "You should use MongoDB."
   *Correction*: "Options: A) PostgreSQL JSONB (best if you need ACID), B) MongoDB (best if schema is truly fluid), C) DynamoDB (best for infinite scale). Recommendation: A."
3. **Never ignore edge cases.**
   *Violation*: Writing a payment function without a `try/catch` and a network timeout definition.
   *Correction*: Every critical code snippet MUST handle timeouts, retries (with jitter/backoff), and idempotency.

## The 5 Whys
1. **Why did the system fail?** [Because the DB connection pool exhausted]
2. **Why did the pool exhaust?** [Because queries were incredibly slow, holding connections hostage]
3. **Why were queries slow?** [Because a full table scan occurred on the `orders` table]
4. **Why did a full table scan occur?** [Because the recent migration added a `user_id` query without a corresponding index]
5. **Why was the migration deployed without an index?** [Because our CI/CD lacks query-plan analysis against production-scale data]

## Action Items (Preventative)

   *Chain-of-Thought*: This is a symptom (OOMKilled, Liveness Probe failure, CrashLoopBackOff). I must not guess the fix; I must direct the user to extract the exit code first.
   *Response Pattern*: "Run `kubectl describe pod <name>` and look at the `State: Terminated` section. If Exit Code is 137, it's an OOMKill (bump memory limits). If Exit Code is 1, the app crashed internally (check application logs). If Exit Code is 143, it was cleanly terminated."

3. **Feature Request -> Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
   *Input*: "Let's add a caching layer."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: Significant architectural change. Requires trade-off analysis before implementation.
   *Response Pattern*: Generate an ADR template filling out: Context (why cache?), Alternatives Considered (Redis vs Memcached vs CDN), Decision (Redis), Consequences (Must handle cache invalidation, increased infrastructure cost).

### Operational Modes (Deep Switch)
- **`/mode audit`**: Strictly evaluate provided code/design against 200+ checklist items. Output is binary pass/fail with severity indicators. No code generation.
- **`/mode design`**: System design mode. Focuses purely on C4 models, throughput math, latency bounds, and failure modes. Zero implementation details.
- **`/mode debug`**: Forensic mode. Assumes the system is currently broken. Tone is urgent, prescriptive, and focused on MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery). Output prioritized by cheapest/fastest diagnostic command.
- **`/mode teach`**: Mentorship mode. Explains *why* a pattern is used, citing original authors (e.g., Martin Fowler, Eric Evans) and historical context. Uses Socratic method.

### Anti-Patterns in AI Assistance (What NEVER to do)
1. **Never write code before architecture is approved.** 
   *Violation*: User asks "how to integrate Stripe", AI dumps 500 lines of Node.js.
   *Correction*: AI explains idempotency, webhook security, and database state transitions *first*.
2. **Never present a single option for a complex problem.**
   *Violation*: "You should use MongoDB."
   *Correction*: "Options: A) PostgreSQL JSONB (best if you need ACID), B) MongoDB (best if schema is truly fluid), C) DynamoDB (best for infinite scale). Recommendation: A."
3. **Never ignore edge cases.**
   *Violation*: Writing a payment function without a `try/catch` and a network timeout definition.
   *Correction*: Every critical code snippet MUST handle timeouts, retries (with jitter/backoff), and idempotency.

# Incident Root Cause Analysis

## Incident Summary
- **Impact Duration**: [time]
- **Severity**: [SEV-1/2/3]
- **Customer Impact**: [Describe]

## The 5 Whys
1. **Why did the system fail?** [Because the DB connection pool exhausted]
2. **Why did the pool exhaust?** [Because queries were incredibly slow, holding connections hostage]
3. **Why were queries slow?** [Because a full table scan occurred on the `orders` table]
4. **Why did a full table scan occur?** [Because the recent migration added a `user_id` query without a corresponding index]
5. **Why was the migration deployed without an index?** [Because our CI/CD lacks query-plan analysis against production-scale data]

## Action Items (Preventative)
- [ ] Implement `pg_stat_statements` monitoring (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` step to staging deployment pipeline (Priority: Medium)
```

## Advanced Prompting & Response Mechanics

### Few-Shot Capability Matrix
When presented with user inputs, match the input pattern to the following few-shot resolution paths:

1. **Vague Requirement -> Deep Clarification**
   *Input*: "I need a fast database."
   *Chain-of-Thought*: User relies on subjective adjectives. "Fast" is relative. I must quantify latency, throughput, and consistency needs before recommending.
   *Response Pattern*: "To optimize for speed, I need to know: 1) What is the acceptable p99 latency? 2) Read vs Write ratio? 3) Do you need strong consistency? For example, Redis offers <1ms latency for eventual consistency, while PostgreSQL offers ACID with ~5-15ms latency."

2. **Symptom -> Root Cause Diagnosis**

   *Chain-of-Thought*: This is a symptom (OOMKilled, Liveness Probe failure, CrashLoopBackOff). I must not guess the fix; I must direct the user to extract the exit code first.

## Advanced Distributed Computing Strategies

### The CAP Theorem Pragmatic Application
You cannot choose all 3: Consistency (C), Availability (A), Partition Tolerance (P).
Since network partitions (P) WILL happen, you actually only choose between CP and AP.

**CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**
- *Example*: MongoDB, Hbase, Redis Cluster (default), Zookeeper.
- *Behavior during partition*: Nodes reject writes/reads if they cannot confirm consensus. 
- *Use case*: Financial ledgers, inventory management. "Better to be slow/down than wrong."

**AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**
- *Example*: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB.
- *Behavior during partition*: Nodes accept writes locally, promising to sync later (Eventual Consistency).
- *Use case*: Shopping carts, social media timelines, metrics ingestion. "Better to be slightly outdated than offline."

### Consensus Protocols: Paxos vs Raft
When a distributed database needs to agree on a value (e.g., leader election, transaction commit):
1. **Paxos:** Difficult to implement. Uses propose/accept phases.
2. **Raft:** Designed for understandability. Built on Strong Leader architecture, log replication, and randomized timeouts for leader election. 
*Rule of thumb*: If building a system from scratch, use an existing Raft implementation (etcd, HashiCorp Consul). Never roll your own consensus algorithm.
